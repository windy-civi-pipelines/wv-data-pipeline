TRANSFERS OF TITLE OR INTEREST. §17A-4-10. Salvage certificates for certain wrecked or damaged vehicles; fee; penalty. (a) In the event a motor vehicle is determined to be a total loss or otherwise designated as totaled by an insurance company or insurer, and upon payment of a total loss claim to an insured or claimant owner for the purchase of the vehicle, the insurance company or the insurer, as a condition of the payment, shall require the owner to surrender the certificate of title: Provided, That an insured or claimant owner may choose to retain physical possession and ownership of a total loss vehicle. If the vehicle owner chooses to retain the vehicle and the vehicle has not been determined to be a cosmetic total loss in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, the insurance company or insurer shall also require the owner to surrender the vehicle registration certificate. The term “total loss” means a motor vehicle which has sustained damages equivalent to seventy-five percent or more of the market value as determined by a nationally accepted used car value guide or meets the definition of a flood-damaged vehicle as defined in this section.(b) The insurance company or insurer shall, prior to the payment of the total loss claim, determine if the vehicle is repairable, cosmetically damaged, or nonrepairable. Except as provided in subsection (p) of this section, within 10 days of payment of the total loss claim, the insurance company or insurer shall surrender the certificate of title, a copy of the claim settlement, a completed application on a form prescribed by the commissioner, and the registration certificate if the owner has chosen to keep the vehicle to the Division of Motor Vehicles.(c) If the insurance company or insurer determines that the vehicle is repairable, the division shall issue a salvage certificate, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, in the name of the insurance company, the insurer, or the vehicle owner if the owner has chosen to retain the vehicle. The certificate shall contain, on the reverse, spaces for one successive assignment before a new certificate at an additional fee is required. Upon the sale of the vehicle, the insurance company, insurer, or vehicle owner if the owner has chosen to retain the vehicle, shall complete the assignment of ownership on the salvage certificate and deliver it to the purchaser. The vehicle may not be titled or registered for operation on the streets or highways of this state unless there is compliance with subsection (h) of this section. The division shall charge a fee of $22.50 for each salvage title issued. The Division of Motor Vehicles may adjust the fee for each salvage title every five years on September 1, based on the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics most current Consumer Price Index: Provided, That an increase in such fee may not exceed 10 percent of the total fee amount in a single year.(d) If the insurance company or insurer determines the damage to a totaled vehicle is exclusively cosmetic and no repair is necessary in order to legally and safely operate the motor vehicle on the roads and highways of this state, the insurance company or insurer shall, upon payment of the claim, submit the certificate of title to the division. Neither the insurance company nor the division may require the vehicle owner to surrender the registration certificate in the event of a cosmetic total loss settlement.(1) The division shall, without further inspection, issue a title branded “cosmetic total loss” to the insured or claimant owner if the insured or claimant owner wishes to retain possession of the vehicle, in lieu of a salvage certificate. The division shall charge a fee of $22.50 for each cosmetic total loss title issued. The terms “cosmetically damaged” and “cosmetic total loss” do not include any vehicle which has been damaged by flood or fire. The designation “cosmetic total loss” on a title may not be removed. The Division of Motor Vehicles may adjust the fee for each cosmetic total loss title every five years on September 1, based on the U. S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics most current Consumer Price Index: Provided, That an increase in such fee may not exceed ten percent of the total fee amount in a single year.(2) If the insured or claimant owner elects not to take possession of the vehicle and the insurance company or insurer retains possession, the division shall issue a cosmetic total loss salvage certificate to the insurance company or insurer.

The Division of Motor Vehicles may adjust the fee for each cosmetic total loss salvage certificate every five years on September 1, based on the U. S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics most current Consumer Price Index: Provided, That an increase in such fee may not exceed ten percent of the total fee amount in a single year. The division shall, upon surrender of the cosmetic total loss salvage certificate issued under the provisions of this paragraph and payment of the five percent motor vehicle sales tax on the fair market value of the vehicle as determined by the commissioner, issue a title branded “cosmetic total loss” without further inspection.(e) If the insurance company or insurer determines that the damage to a totaled vehicle renders it nonrepairable, incapable of safe operation for use on roads and highways, and as having no resale value except as a source of parts or scrap, the insurance company or vehicle owner shall, in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, request that the division issue a nonrepairable motor vehicle certificate in lieu of a salvage certificate. The division shall issue a nonrepairable motor vehicle certificate without charge.(f) Any owner who scraps, compresses, dismantles, or destroys a vehicle without further transfer or sale for which a certificate of title, nonrepairable motor vehicle certificate, or salvage certificate has been issued shall, within 45 days, surrender the certificate of title, nonrepairable motor vehicle certificate, or salvage certificate to the division for cancellation.(g) Any person who purchases or acquires a vehicle as salvage or scrap, to be dismantled, compressed, or destroyed, shall, within 45 days, surrender to the division the certificate of title, nonrepairable motor vehicle certificate, salvage certificate, or a statement of cancellation signed by the seller, on a form prescribed by the commissioner. Subsequent purchasers of salvage or scrap are not required to comply with the notification requirement.(h) If the motor vehicle is a “reconstructed vehicle” as defined in this section or §17A-1-1 of this code, it may not be titled or registered for operation until it has been inspected by an official state inspection station and by the Division of Motor Vehicles.

However, upon application for a certificate of title for a reconstructed, cosmetic total loss, flood or fire damaged vehicle, or other brand, the division shall collect the five percent privilege tax on the fair market value of the vehicle as determined by the commissioner unless the applicant is otherwise exempt from the payment of such privilege tax. A wrecker/dismantler/rebuilder, licensed by the division, is exempt from the payment of the five percent privilege tax upon titling a reconstructed vehicle. The division shall collect a fee of $35 per vehicle for inspections of reconstructed vehicles. These fees shall be deposited in a special fund created in the State Treasurer’s office and may be expended by the division to carry out the provisions of this article: Provided, That on and after July 1, 2007, any balance in the special fund and all fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the State Road Fund.

Such information shall include the name and address of the lienholder, the kind of and nature of the lien, the date thereof, and the amount thereby secured. However, only the name and address of the lienholder shall be endorsed on the title certificate with the endorsement of the fact of such lien as hereinafter provided. The department division, if satisfied that it is proper that the same be recorded, and upon surrender of the certificate of title covering the vehicle, shall thereupon issue a new certificate of title, showing the liens or encumbrances in the order of their filing being according to the date, hour, and minute of receipt by the department division of the application for the same. For the purpose of recording a subsequent lien on a certificate of title, the subsequent lienholder shall make a written request upon the lienholder in possession of the certificate of title, accompanied by proof of the existence of the subsequent lien, stating his or her need to have possession of the certificate of title for the purpose of having his or her lien recorded thereon by the division of Motor Vehicles. Thereupon, the lienholder in possession of the certificate shall within a reasonable time, not to exceed 10 days from the receipt of said written request, deliver the certificate of title to the requesting subsequent lienholder.Upon delivery of the certificate of title, the subsequent lienholder shall immediately forward it and the lienholder's own application to the division of Motor Vehicles for the filing of the lien and for the recording of the same on the certificate of title.

Any lien or encumbrance placed on such vehicles by the voluntary act of the owner shall be created and perfected in accordance with the provisions of §46-9-1 et seq. of this code. §17A-4A-2a. Electronic transfer of liens. (a) Notwithstanding any requirement in this chapter that a lien on a motor vehicle shall be noted on the face of the certificate of title, if there are one or more liens or encumbrance on a vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, pole trailer, factory-built home, or recreational vehicle, the division may electronically transmit the lien to the first lienholder and notify the first lienholder of any additional liens. Subsequent lien satisfactions may be electronically transmitted to the division and shall include the name and address of the person satisfying the lien and any other information required by the division as a condition of participating in the electronic lien information exchange program. (b) The division may enter into agreements with a service provider or providers to administer the electronic exchange of lien information between dealers, financial institutions, and the division. For the purposes of this section, the term financial institutions shall have the same meaning as defined in §17A-6-10b of this code.(c) When electronic transmission of liens and lien satisfaction is used, a hard copy certificate of title need not be issued until the last lien is satisfied and a clear hard copy certificate of title is issued to the owner of the vehicle. When a vehicle is subject to an electronic lien, the certificate of title for the vehicle shall be considered to be physically held by the lienholder for the purpose of compliance with state and federal odometer disclosure requirements and for any other requirement of this code. A duly certified copy of the division's electronic record of the certificate of title and lien shall be admissible in any civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding in this state as evidence of the existence of the lien.(d) For the purposes of this chapter, whenever reference is made by this code to the physical production of a certificate of title as a paper document, or reference to the completion of information related to recording a lien as a paper document, the reference shall be understood to also include the transmission and recordation of the information in an electronic format.(e) Beginning July 1, 2025, all financial institutions recording five or more liens in a calendar year shall use the division's electronic lien and title system for all lien actions. The division is not required to issue certificates of title as a paper document to a lienholder after the division’s electronic lien and title system is fully implemented: Provided, That nothing in this section invalidates, prohibits a person from requesting, or prevents the division from issuing a certificate of title as a paper document.

ARTICLE 4A. LIENS AND ENCUMBRANCES ON VEHICLES TO BE SHOWN ON CERTIFICATE OF TITLE; NOTICE TO CREDITORS AND PURCHASERS. §17A-4A-2. Liens and encumbrances subsequently created. (a) Liens or encumbrances placed on vehicles by the voluntary act of the owner after the original issue of title to be properly recorded must be shown on the certificate of title. In such cases, the owner or lienholder shall file application with the department division on a blank furnished for that purpose, setting forth the lien or liens and such information and evidence of the lien in connection therewith as the department division may deem necessary. Such information shall include the name and address of the lienholder, the kind of and nature of the lien, the date thereof, and the amount thereby secured. However, only the name and address of the lienholder shall be endorsed on the title certificate with the endorsement of the fact of such lien as hereinafter provided. The department division, if satisfied that it is proper that the same be recorded, and upon surrender of the certificate of title covering the vehicle, shall thereupon issue a new certificate of title, showing the liens or encumbrances in the order of their filing being according to the date, hour, and minute of receipt by the department division of the application for the same. For the purpose of recording a subsequent lien on a certificate of title, the subsequent lienholder shall make a written request upon the lienholder in possession of the certificate of title, accompanied by proof of the existence of the subsequent lien, stating his or her need to have possession of the certificate of title for the purpose of having his or her lien recorded thereon by the division of Motor Vehicles. Thereupon, the lienholder in possession of the certificate shall within a reasonable time, not to exceed 10 days from the receipt of said written request, deliver the certificate of title to the requesting subsequent lienholder.Upon delivery of the certificate of title, the subsequent lienholder shall immediately forward it and the lienholder's own application to the division of Motor Vehicles for the filing of the lien and for the recording of the same on the certificate of title. Upon issuing the new certificate, the department division shall thereupon send or deliver it to the holder of the first lien.(b) The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to: (1) Vehicles held as inventory for sale by a registered dealer holding title by assignment entered upon a certificate of title; or (2) vehicles for which certificates of title have been issued and are held as inventory for lease by a vehicle rental agency or similar person engaged solely in the business of leasing vehicles. Any lien or encumbrance placed on such vehicles by the voluntary act of the owner shall be created and perfected in accordance with the provisions of §46-9-1 et seq. of this code. §17A-4A-2a. Electronic transfer of liens. (a) Notwithstanding any requirement in this chapter that a lien on a motor vehicle shall be noted on the face of the certificate of title, if there are one or more liens or encumbrance on a vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, pole trailer, factory-built home, or recreational vehicle, the division may electronically transmit the lien to the first lienholder and notify the first lienholder of any additional liens. Subsequent lien satisfactions may be electronically transmitted to the division and shall include the name and address of the person satisfying the lien and any other information required by the division as a condition of participating in the electronic lien information exchange program. (b) The division may enter into agreements with a service provider or providers to administer the electronic exchange of lien information between dealers, financial institutions, and the division. For the purposes of this section, the term financial institutions shall have the same meaning as defined in §17A-6-10b of this code.(c) When electronic transmission of liens and lien satisfaction is used, a hard copy certificate of title need not be issued until the last lien is satisfied and a clear hard copy certificate of title is issued to the owner of the vehicle. When a vehicle is subject to an electronic lien, the certificate of title for the vehicle shall be considered to be physically held by the lienholder for the purpose of compliance with state and federal odometer disclosure requirements and for any other requirement of this code. A duly certified copy of the division's electronic record of the certificate of title and lien shall be admissible in any civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding in this state as evidence of the existence of the lien.(d) For the purposes of this chapter, whenever reference is made by this code to the physical production of a certificate of title as a paper document, or reference to the completion of information related to recording a lien as a paper document, the reference shall be understood to also include the transmission and recordation of the information in an electronic format.(e) Beginning July 1, 2025, all financial institutions recording five or more liens in a calendar year shall use the division's electronic lien and title system for all lien actions. The division is not required to issue certificates of title as a paper document to a lienholder after the division’s electronic lien and title system is fully implemented: Provided, That nothing in this section invalidates, prohibits a person from requesting, or prevents the division from issuing a certificate of title as a paper document.
