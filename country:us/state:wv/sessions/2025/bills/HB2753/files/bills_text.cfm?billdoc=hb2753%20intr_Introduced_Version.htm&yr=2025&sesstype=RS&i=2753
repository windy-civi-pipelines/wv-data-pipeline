	<p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(a) Persons subject to section. &mdash; The provisions of this section apply to all public officials and public employees, whether full or part-time and whether compensated or not, in state, county, municipal governments and their respective boards, agencies, departments, and commissions and in any other regional or local governmental agency, including county school boards.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(b) Use of public office for private gain. &mdash; (1) A public official or public employee may not knowingly and intentionally use his or her office or the prestige of his or her office for his or her own private gain or that of another person. Incidental use of equipment or resources available to a public official or public employee by virtue of his or her position for personal or business purposes resulting in de minimis private gain does not constitute use of public office for private gain under this subsection. The performance of usual and customary duties associated with the office or position or the advancement of public policy goals or constituent services, without compensation, does not constitute the use of prestige of office for private gain.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) Notwithstanding the general prohibition against use of office for private gain, public officials and public employees may use bonus points acquired through participation in frequent traveler programs while traveling on official government business: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided</span><span class="csE736517A">, That the official&rsquo;s or employee&rsquo;s participation in such program, or acquisition of such points, does not result in additional costs to the government.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(3) The Legislature, in enacting this subsection, recognizes that there may be certain public officials or public employees who bring to their respective offices or employment their own unique personal prestige which is based upon their intelligence, education, experience, skills and abilities, or other personal gifts or traits. In many cases, these persons bring a personal prestige to their office or employment which inures to the benefit of the state and its citizens. Those persons may, in fact, be sought by the state to serve in their office or employment because, through their unusual gifts or traits, they bring stature and recognition to their office or employment and to the state itself. While the office or employment held or to be held by those persons may have its own inherent prestige, it would be unfair to those individuals and against the best interests of the citizens of this state to deny those persons the right to hold public office or to be publicly employed on the grounds that they would, in addition to the emoluments of their office or employment, be in a position to benefit financially from the personal prestige which otherwise inheres to them. Accordingly, the commission is directed, by legislative rule, to establish categories of public officials and public employees, identifying them generally by the office or employment held, and offering persons who fit within those categories the opportunity to apply for an exemption from the application of the provisions of this subsection. Exemptions may be granted by the commission, on a case-by-case basis, when it is shown that: (A) The public office held or the public employment engaged in is not such that it would ordinarily be available or offered to a substantial number of the citizens of this state; (B) the office held or the employment engaged in is such that it normally or specifically requires a person who possesses personal prestige; and (C) the person&rsquo;s employment contract or letter of appointment provides or anticipates that the person will gain financially from activities which are not a part of his or her office or employment.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(4) A public official or public employee may not show favoritism or grant patronage in the employment or working conditions of his or her relative or a person with whom he or she resides: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided</span><span class="csE736517A">, That as used in this subdivision, &quot;employment or working conditions&quot; shall only apply to government employment: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided, however</span><span class="csE736517A">, That government employment includes only those governmental entities specified in subsection (a) of this section.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(c) Gifts. &mdash; (1) A public official or public employee may not solicit any gift unless the solicitation is for a charitable purpose with no resulting direct pecuniary benefit conferred upon the official or employee or his or her immediate family: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided</span><span class="csE736517A">, That no public official or public employee may solicit for a charitable purpose any gift from any person who is also an official or employee of the state and whose position is subordinate to the soliciting official or employee: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided, however</span><span class="csE736517A">, That nothing herein shall prohibit a candidate for public office from soliciting a lawful political contribution.

This presumption may be rebutted only by direct objective evidence that the gift did impair the impartiality and independent judgment of the person or that the person knew or had reason to know that the gift was offered with the intent to impair his or her impartiality and independent judgment. The provisions of subdivision (1) of this subsection do not apply to:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(A) Meals and beverages;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(B) Ceremonial gifts or awards which have insignificant monetary value;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(C) Unsolicited gifts of nominal value or trivial items of informational value;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(D) Reasonable expenses for food, travel, and lodging of the official or employee for a meeting at which the official or employee participates in a panel or has a speaking engagement;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(E) Gifts of tickets or free admission extended to a public official or public employee to attend charitable, cultural, or political events, if the purpose of such gift or admission is a courtesy or ceremony customarily extended to the office;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(F) Gifts that are purely private and personal in nature; or</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(G) Gifts from relatives by blood or marriage, or a member of the same household.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(3) The commission shall, through legislative rule promulgated pursuant to chapter 29A of this code, establish guidelines for the acceptance of a reasonable honorarium by public officials and elected officials. The rule promulgated shall be consistent with this section. Any elected public official may accept an honorarium only when:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(A) That official is a part-time elected public official;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(B) The fee is not related to the official&rsquo;s public position or duties;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(C) The fee is for services provided by the public official that are related to the public official&rsquo;s regular, nonpublic trade, profession, occupation, hobby, or avocation; and</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(D) The honorarium is not provided in exchange for any promise or action on the part of the public official.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to prohibit the giving of a lawful political contribution as defined by law.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(5) The Governor or his designee may, in the name of the State of West Virginia, accept and receive gifts from any public or private source.
