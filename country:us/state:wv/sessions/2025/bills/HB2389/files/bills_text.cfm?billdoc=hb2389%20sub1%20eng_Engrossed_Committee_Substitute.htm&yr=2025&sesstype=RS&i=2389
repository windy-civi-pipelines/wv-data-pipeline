Public notice of any revision shall be posted on the website of the compact commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the compact commission.(n) No member state’s rulemaking requirements shall apply under this compact. §30-35A-11.

A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.(d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the compact commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, the defaulting state’s licensing authority, and each of the member states’ licensing authority.(e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.(f) Upon the termination of a state’s membership from this compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination.

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.(c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.(d) This compact may be amended by the member states.

Public notice of any revision shall be posted on the website of the compact commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the compact commission.(n) No member state’s rulemaking requirements shall apply under this compact. §30-35A-11.

The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the compact commission may take and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.(2) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.(c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.(d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the compact commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, the defaulting state’s licensing authority, and each of the member states’ licensing authority.(e) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.(f) Upon the termination of a state’s membership from this compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination.

The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the compact commission. The compact commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state’s law.(2) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.(3) No party other than a member state shall enforce this compact against the compact commission. §30-35A-12.  EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT. (a) The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh member state.(1) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven member states ("charter member states") to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact statute.(A) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model compact statute shall be entitled to the default process set forth in §30-35A-11 of this code.(B) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated, or withdraws from the compact, the compact commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of member states should be less than seven.(2) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member states shall be subject to the process set forth in §30-35A-8(C)(21) of this code to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.(3) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the compact commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the compact commission unless specifically repudiated by the compact commission.(4) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact commission’s initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the compact commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.(b)  Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.(1) A member state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the repealing statute.(2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state’s licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.(3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.(c) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.(d) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states. §30-35A-13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY. (a) This compact and the compact commission’s rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the compact commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.(b) The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of §30-35A-13(b) of this code, the compact commission may deny a state’s participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of §30-35A-11(b) of this code, terminate a member state’s participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters. §30-35A-14. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS. (a) Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact.(b) Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.(c) All permissible agreements between the compact commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
