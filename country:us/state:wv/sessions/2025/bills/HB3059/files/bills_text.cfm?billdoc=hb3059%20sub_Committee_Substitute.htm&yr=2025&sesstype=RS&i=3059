The commission may accept a railroad&#39;s agreement to maintain the installation as being its share of the cost for the protection. If any part of the cost is assigned to the public, it shall be apportioned to the state agency or political subdivision having jurisdiction over such crossing, and may be paid from any funds levied and made available for highway or street purposes; provided, that funds from the grade crossing protection fund created by this article may be used to pay the public&#39;s share of the cost. After the commission has issued an appropriate order requiring that additional protective devices be installed by a specific date, which shall be a reasonable time from the date of the order, the railroad concerned shall erect or install the additional protective devices or station the flagman within the time prescribed by the order. If the additional protective devices are not erected or installed within that time, the commission may reduce or eliminate the amount of any funds in the grade crossing protection fund obligated to pay the public&#39;s share of the costs relating to the erection, installation, and maintenance of the additional protective devices and, consistent with any applicable federal requirements, may assign to the railroad concerned any amount, up to 100 percent of the total amount, of the costs of erecting, installing, and maintaining the additional protective devices.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(c) Any person owning or operating a railroad and neglecting or refusing to erect or maintain such gate, automatic alarm bell, or other mechanical device, or to maintain such flagman, when required by the commission pursuant to this article, and after the commission has issued an appropriate order finding that the public funds will be made available with respect to any protective device it has ordered installed, shall forfeit to the state, for every such neglect or refusal, one thousand dollars, and in addition, shall forfeit one thousand dollars for each day such neglect or refusal continues.</span></p><h4 class="csCA36641A">

Such gates shall be so constructed that when closed they obstruct or prevent passage across such railroad from the side on which a gate is located. Such bell must be so constructed that it will ring before the approach of every train of cars or locomotive within 300 feet or more of such crossing, and continue to ring until such train or locomotive has reached the crossing. A person shall be in charge of such gate who shall close it at the approach of each train or locomotive and keep it open at all other times.
