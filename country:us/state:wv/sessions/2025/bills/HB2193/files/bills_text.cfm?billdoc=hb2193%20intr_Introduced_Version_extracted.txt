MOTOR FUEL EXCISE TAX elimination. §11-14D-1. Findings. In an effort to attract more people to West Virginia, through tourism, job creation, recreation, or otherwise, the West Virginia Legislature finds that drivers who pay less in gasoline, diesel, and fuel prices as a whole will be more inclined to visit the state because of these reduced fuel prices.  By reducing the state gasoline tax and state diesel tax to zero, more individuals will want to come to West Virginia to purchase fuel. This elimination of the motor fuel excise tax can be done in a revenue neutral fashion with an equivalent increase in the state sales tax by the percentage of the current motor fuel excise tax rate. When gas prices are higher, motorists generally drive less. A reduction of the motor fuel excise tax will get drivers back on the road in West Virginia. Rising inflation also presents an opportunity to collect revenue more easily, and, sales taxes generally keep up with inflation better than do excise taxes, such as the motor fuel excise tax currently in place. This reduction in the motor vehicle excise tax rate will help working class families in West Virginia to pay less for fuel and would mean more money in their pockets. Further, this elimination of the motor fuel excise tax will allow those who drive exclusively electric cars to pay their fair share in taxes through the subsequent increase in the sales tax. Finally, the elimination of the motor fuel excise tax will not affect airline fuel taxation otherwise collected. §11-14D-2. Elimination of tax; revenue neutrality. There is presently levied on all motor fuel an excise tax composed of a flat rate equal to 20.50 cents per invoiced gallon of regular gasoline and diesel fuel, and on alternative fuel, on each gallon equivalent, plus a variable component comprised of five percent of the average wholesale price of the motor fuel: Provided, That the tax per gallon may not be less than 15.20 cents per gallon of motor fuel; and on alternative fuel, either the tax imposed by §11-15-18b or the tax imposed under §11-15A-13a, as applicable. The variable component of the tax on alternative fuel is equal to five percent of the average wholesale price of the alternative fuel.Upon passage of this article, the motor fuel excise tax shall be reduced to zero, and the sales tax shall be increased to seven and eight-tenths percent. One and eight-tenths percent of the amount of the sales tax rate shall be dedicated to the state road fund, and the remaining six percent shall be sent where otherwise originally provided for in this code. This reduction of the motor fuel excise tax does not apply to airline fuel that is collected and provided for otherwise in this code. §11-14D-3. Effective date. The provisions of this article shall take effect July 1, 2025.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to eliminate the motor fuel excise tax and to replace any income from the tax with an equivalent increase in the state sales tax.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
