Red = new code to be enacted HOUSE RESOLUTION 9 (By Delegates Hornbuckle, Fluharty, Garcia, Hamilton, Hansen, Lewis, Pushkin, Williams, and Young) [March 18, 2025; Referredto the committee on Rules ] Urging the Governor and our federal representatives to assist West Virginians at risk of losing their federal jobs and to do all in their power to prevent these job losses in our state.Whereas, West Virginia has more than 17,000 employees at federal agencies living in the state; andWhereas, In West Virginia, a small state with a shrinking population and low workforce participation, any federal job cuts to our citizens will have a disproportionately severe impact on both our local communities and our state's fiscal stability; andWhereas, Already, between 200 and 250 workers at a longstanding federal employer in Parkersburg have lost their jobs through actions of the Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk. This is purportedly just one of the many anticipated cuts to the federal workforce which will impact our state; andWhereas, This loss of jobs to the Parkersburg area is a huge financial blow to that city and Wood County; andWhereas, As additional layoffs occur, the state must prepare for the impacts to our economy, particularly in the eastern panhandle, Marion and Harrison Counties, and other areas of the state where there are clusters of federally employed West Virginians; andWhereas, Along with the impact layoffs will have on employees and their families, small business will suffer, fired employees will leave the state, and the need for social services will increase for those who remain; andWhereas, It is critical to the economy of West Virginia that high paying, high benefit jobs are preserved and it is the paramount duty of the state's Governor and our representatives in Congress to make every effort to prevent this from happening; therefore, be itResolved by the House of Delegates:The House of Delegates urges our Governor and federal delegation to fight for all jobs in the state and to not succumb to the elimination of valuable government employee jobs. This value is represented by the chronically understaffed Internal Revenue Service who provide a vital service to our fellow countrymen. The notion that these jobs are being lost to combat fraud, waste, and abuse is contrived because, in reality, the true motive is to justify a big tax cut for billionaires; and, be itFurther Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates forward a copy of this resolution to the Governor and all West Virginia's federally elected representatives.
