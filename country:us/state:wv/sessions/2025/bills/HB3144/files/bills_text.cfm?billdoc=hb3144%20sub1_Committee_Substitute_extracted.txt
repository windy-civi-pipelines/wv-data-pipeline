The site boundary from which the 30 feet is measured excludes any access or utility easements currently related to the site;(v) It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support structure; or(vi) It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure or base station equipment: Provided however, That this limitation does not apply to any modification that is non-compliant only in a manner that would not exceed the thresholds identified in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(7)(i) through (iv)."Transmission equipment" means equipment that facilitates transmission for any Commission-licensed or authorized wireless communication service, including, but not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and regular and backup power supply.

A state or local government may not deny and shall approve an application for a modification of an existing wireless service facility if:(1) The request modification would not substantially change the physical dimensions of the wireless service facility;(2) The requested modification involves:(A) Colocation of new transmission equipment;(B) Removal of transmission equipment; or(C) Replacement of transmission equipment; and (3) The request meets the requirements of this section.(c) Documentation requirement for review. When an applicant asserts in writing that a request for modification is covered by this section, the reviewing authority may require the applicant to provide documentation or information only to the extent reasonably related to determining whether the request meets the requirements of this section. The reviewing authority may not require an applicant to submit any other documentation, including but not limited to documentation intended to illustrate the need for such wireless facilities or to justify the business decision to modify such wireless facilities.(d) Fees for applications.  A reviewing authority may not impose on an applicant fees or charges that exceed the one-time non-recurring reasonable costs actually incurred by the reviewing authority to review the application.(e) Timeframe for review.

The 60-day period begins to run when the application is filed and may be tolled only by mutual agreement or in cases where the reviewing state or local government determines that the application is incomplete. The timeframe for review is not tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications.(1) To toll the timeframe for incompleteness, the reviewing state or local government must provide written notice to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application, clearly and specifically delineating all missing documents or information. Such delineated information is limited to documents or information meeting the standard under §31J-1-3(c).(2) The timeframe for review begins running again when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the state or local government's notice of incompleteness.(3) Following a supplemental submission, the state or local government will have 10 days to notify the applicant that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The timeframe is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in §31J-1-3(e). Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that were not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.(g) Failure to act.

The deemed grant does not become effective until the applicant notifies the reviewing authority in writing after the review period has expired (accounting for any tolling) that the application has been deemed granted. §31J-1-4. Construction code. The state adopts and incorporates by reference the current TIA 222 Standard of the International Building Code, as amended, as the applicable wireless infrastructure construction code. §31J-1-5. Remedies. Applicants and reviewing authorities may bring claims related to this Chapter to any court of competent jurisdiction. §31J-1-6. Prior law, interpretations, preemption preserved.

Within 60 days of the date on which an applicant submits a request seeking approval under this section, the reviewing authority shall approve the application unless it determines that the application is not covered by this section.(f) Tolling of the timeframe for review. The 60-day period begins to run when the application is filed and may be tolled only by mutual agreement or in cases where the reviewing state or local government determines that the application is incomplete. The timeframe for review is not tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications.(1) To toll the timeframe for incompleteness, the reviewing state or local government must provide written notice to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application, clearly and specifically delineating all missing documents or information. Such delineated information is limited to documents or information meeting the standard under §31J-1-3(c).(2) The timeframe for review begins running again when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the state or local government's notice of incompleteness.(3) Following a supplemental submission, the state or local government will have 10 days to notify the applicant that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The timeframe is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in §31J-1-3(e). Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that were not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.(g) Failure to act. In the event the reviewing authority fails to approve or deny a request seeking approval under this section within the timeframe for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be deemed granted. The deemed grant does not become effective until the applicant notifies the reviewing authority in writing after the review period has expired (accounting for any tolling) that the application has been deemed granted. §31J-1-4. Construction code. The state adopts and incorporates by reference the current TIA 222 Standard of the International Building Code, as amended, as the applicable wireless infrastructure construction code. §31J-1-5. Remedies. Applicants and reviewing authorities may bring claims related to this Chapter to any court of competent jurisdiction. §31J-1-6. Prior law, interpretations, preemption preserved. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to change or otherwise impact the application of this state’s existing West Virginia Small Wireless Facilities Development Act, being §31H-1-1 et seq. of this code; the Vertical Real Estate Management and Availability Act, being §31G-5-1 et seq. of this code; or the state’s existing Pre-emption of Conflicting Local Ordinances and Private Restrictions statute, being §31G-6-1 et seq. of this code.
