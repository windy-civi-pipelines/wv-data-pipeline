Innocent Owner. (a) The property of an innocent owner may not be forfeited.(b) An innocent owner having an ownership interest in property subject to forfeiture existing at the time that the illegal conduct giving rise to forfeiture occurred bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the said innocent owner has a legal right, title, or interest in the property seized under this chapter.(c) If the requirements of subsection (b) of this section are satisfied and the state seeks to proceed with the forfeiture, the state shall prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the alleged innocent owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the underlying crime giving rise to the forfeiture. (d) A person who acquired an ownership interest in property subject to forfeiture after the commission of a crime giving rise to the forfeiture and who claims to be an innocent owner bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the person has legal right, title, or interest in the property seized under this chapter.(e) If the requirements of subsection (d) of this section are met and the state seeks to proceed with the forfeiture against the property, the state shall prove by a preponderance of the evidence that at the time the person acquired the property the person:(1) Had actual or constructive knowledge that the property was subject to forfeiture; or(2) Was not a bona fide purchaser without notice of any defect in title and for valuable consideration.

(a) The property of an innocent owner may not be forfeited.(b) An innocent owner having an ownership interest in property subject to forfeiture existing at the time that the illegal conduct giving rise to forfeiture occurred bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the said innocent owner has a legal right, title, or interest in the property seized under this chapter.(c) If the requirements of subsection (b) of this section are satisfied and the state seeks to proceed with the forfeiture, the state shall prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the alleged innocent owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the underlying crime giving rise to the forfeiture. (d) A person who acquired an ownership interest in property subject to forfeiture after the commission of a crime giving rise to the forfeiture and who claims to be an innocent owner bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the person has legal right, title, or interest in the property seized under this chapter.(e) If the requirements of subsection (d) of this section are met and the state seeks to proceed with the forfeiture against the property, the state shall prove by a preponderance of the evidence that at the time the person acquired the property the person:(1) Had actual or constructive knowledge that the property was subject to forfeiture; or(2) Was not a bona fide purchaser without notice of any defect in title and for valuable consideration.
