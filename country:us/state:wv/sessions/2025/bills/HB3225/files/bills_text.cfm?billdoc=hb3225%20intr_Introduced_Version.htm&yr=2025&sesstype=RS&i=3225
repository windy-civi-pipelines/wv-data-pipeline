EDUCATION. ARTICLE 2. STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. §18-2-46. Statewide initiative to promote teacher preparation programs aimed at underrepresented groups. (a) Legislative findings. – The Legislature finds that there are underrepresented portions of the population serving as public educators in this state. Minorities, males, and those persons in rural, isolated, or impoverished areas have had increased difficulty finding employment in the field of public education. Some of these individuals may not be aware of opportunities available to them to become educators, while others may not know the process to become a teacher. For this reason, it is necessary for the West Virginia State Board of Education to create an initiative to provide minorities, males, and those in isolated areas with an incentive to join the public education field and become teachers in this state. Surrounding states have implemented similar initiatives with success, and the teacher shortage in West Virginia could be alleviated by employing more persons in these underrepresented groups. (b) Definitions. – For purposes of this initiative, "underrepresented groups" as educators includes the following:(1) Minorities;(2) Males; or(3) Those persons in rural, isolated, or impoverished areas. (c) Enactment. – The West Virginia State Board of Education shall develop an initiative to attract underrepresented groups to become educators.

This initiative shall also include information relating to the scholarship opportunity set forth in §18C-10-1 et seq. of this code. ARTICLE 5. COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. §18-5-52. County initiative to promote teacher preparation programs aimed at underrepresented groups. (a) Legislative findings. – The Legislature finds that there are underrepresented portions of the population serving as public educators in this state. Minorities, males, and those persons in rural, isolated, or impoverished areas have had increased difficulty finding employment in the field of public education. Some of these individuals may not be aware of opportunities available to them to become educators, while others may not know the process to become a teacher. For this reason, it is necessary for county boards of education in this state to create an initiative to provide minorities, males, and those in isolated areas with an incentive to join the public education field and become teachers in this state. Surrounding states have implemented similar initiatives with success, and the teacher shortage in West Virginia could be alleviated by employing more persons in these underrepresented groups. (b) Definitions. – For purposes of this initiative, "underrepresented groups" as educators includes the following:(1) Minorities;(2) Males; or(3) Those persons in rural, isolated, or impoverished areas.
