	<p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(a) The Legislature finds that continued economic growth in West Virginia creates a responsibility in the state for the furtherance of the general welfare of our citizens. &nbsp;The state&rsquo;s focus on and promotion of economic development has created a business-friendly atmosphere for businesses to continue to remain and locate here. &nbsp;The continued development of a business-friendly environment must include factors to promote positive social and personal development.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(b) As our economy continues to experience change and is restructured from being primarily energy based, our population will also shift. &nbsp;This shift will create a need for additional services, most importantly in the housing and housing development sector. As the state encourages business activity and creates a more balanced economic base the state must be mindful of the need of the workers who are gainfully employed in this state and who are necessary to accomplish the purposes of both entities that are presently doing business here and potential businesses considering this state for future business activity and commerce. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(c) The constraints on obtaining funding for housing construction potentially creates a hinderance to continued economic development as businesses consider West Virginia as an option. &nbsp;Workers who may locate here as businesses move here have an expectation of their quality of life. &nbsp;Fulfilling this expectation is a necessary component of the state&#39;s economic development. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(d) Therefore, the Legislature recognizes the need to support and encourage business entities and realizes that they can only achieve success with a quality, hardworking, gainfully employed workforce. To achieve and advance a better workforce in this state, the Legislature hereby establishes the Mountain Homes Act, with the intent to remove barriers to funding for home construction with the goal of promoting a sustainable quality of life for the state&#39;s workforce. &nbsp;</span></p><h4 class="csCA36641A">
