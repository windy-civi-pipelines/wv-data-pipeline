As the state encourages business activity and creates a more balanced economic base the state must be mindful of the need of the workers who are gainfully employed in this state and who are necessary to accomplish the purposes of both entities that are presently doing business here and potential businesses considering this state for future business activity and commerce.  (c) The constraints on obtaining funding for housing construction potentially creates a hinderance to continued economic development as businesses consider West Virginia as an option.  Workers who may locate here as businesses move here have an expectation of their quality of life.  Fulfilling this expectation is a necessary component of the state's economic development.  (d) Therefore, the Legislature recognizes the need to support and encourage business entities and realizes that they can only achieve success with a quality, hardworking, gainfully employed workforce.
