The actuary shall also assist in the development of alternative financing options and perform any other services requested by the finance board or the director. All reasonable fees and expenses for actuarial services shall be paid by the West Virginia Portable Insurance Benefit Plan. Any financial plan or modifications to a financial plan approved or proposed by the finance board shall be submitted to and reviewed by the actuary and may not be finally approved and submitted to the Governor and to the Legislature without the actuary's written professional opinion that the plan may be reasonably expected to generate sufficient revenues to meet all estimated program and administrative costs of the agency, including incurred but unreported claims, for the fiscal year for which the plan is proposed. (c) All financial plans shall establish:(1) The minimum level of reimbursement at 110% of the Medicare amount for all providers: Provided, That the plan shall reimburse a West Virginia hospital that provides inpatient medical care to a beneficiary, covered by the state and non-state plans, at a minimum rate of 110% of the Medicare diagnosis-related group rate for the admission, or the Medicare per diem, per day rate applicable to a critical access hospital, as appropriate: Provided, however, That the rates established pursuant to this subdivision do not apply to any Medicare primary retiree health plan.

The financial plans may also include optional alternative benefit plans with alternative types and levels of cost. The finance board may develop policies which encourage the use of West Virginia health care providers.In addition, the finance board may allocate a portion of the premium costs charged to participating hiring parties to subsidize the cost of coverage for participating retired independent contractors, on such terms as the finance board determines are equitable and financially responsible.(d)(1) The finance board shall prepare an annual financial plan for each fiscal year. The finance board chairman shall request the actuary to estimate the total financial requirements of the West Virginia Portable Insurance Benefit Plan for the fiscal year.(2) The finance board shall prepare a proposed financial plan designed to generate revenues sufficient to meet all estimated program and administrative costs of the West Virginia Portable Insurance Benefit Plan for the fiscal year.

Before final adoption of the proposed financial plan, the finance board shall request the actuary to review the plan and to render a written professional opinion stating whether the plan will generate sufficient revenues to meet all estimated program and administrative costs of the West Virginia Portable Insurance Benefit Plan for the fiscal year. The actuary's report shall explain the basis of its opinion.

After the submission of the initial prospective plan, the board may not increase costs to the participating hiring parties or change the average of the premiums, deductibles, and copays for independent contractors, except in the event of a true emergency. If the board invokes the emergency provisions, the cost shall be borne between the contributing hiring parties and independent contractors in proportion to the cost-sharing ratio applicable to those hiring parties that do contribute for that plan year. For purposes of this section, "emergency" means that the most recent projections demonstrate that plan expenses will exceed plan revenues by more than one percent in any plan year. In the event of an emergency, the cost of the premiums may be offset by a legislative appropriation for that purpose.(h) The finance board shall meet on at least a quarterly basis to review implementation of its current financial plan in light of the actual experience of the West Virginia Portable Insurance Benefit Plan. The board shall review actual costs incurred, any revised cost estimates provided by the actuary, expenditures, and any other factors affecting the fiscal stability of the plan, and may make any additional modifications to the plan necessary to ensure that the total financial requirements of the agency for the current fiscal year are met.
