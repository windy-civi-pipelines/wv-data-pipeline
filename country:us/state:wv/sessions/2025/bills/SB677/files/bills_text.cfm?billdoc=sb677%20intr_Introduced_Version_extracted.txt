REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES. §32-3-305. Provisions applicable to registration and notice filing generally. (a) A registration or notice filing statement may be filed by the issuer, any other person on whose behalf the offering is to be made or a registered broker-dealer. A registration or notice filing statement filed under this chapter registering or noticing investment company shares shall cover only one class, series or portfolio of investment company shares.(b) Every person filing a registration or notice filing statement shall pay a filing fee of one sixteenth of one percent of the maximum aggregate offering price at which the registered or noticed securities are to be offered in this state, but the fee shall in no case be less than $60 or more than $1800. When a registration or notice filing statement is withdrawn before the effective date or a preeffective stop order is entered under section three hundred six of this article, the commissioner shall retain all of the fee.(c) Every registration statement and notice filing shall specify: (1) The amount of securities to be offered in this state; (2) the states in which a registration statement or similar document in connection with the offering has been or is to be filed; and (3) any adverse order, judgment or decree entered in connection with the offering by the regulatory authorities in each state or by any court or the securities and exchange commission.(d) In any case where securities sold in this state are in excess of the aggregate amount of securities specified under subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner may require payment of an oversale assessment which shall be three times an amount which equals the difference between the filing fee that would have been payable under subsection (b) of this section based upon the total amount of securities sold in this state and the total filing fees previously paid to the commissioner with respect to such registration or notice filing, but in no case shall the oversale assessment be less than $420 or be more than $1800. (e) Any document filed under this chapter or a predecessor act within five years preceding the filing of a registration statement may be incorporated by reference in the registration statement to the extent that the document is currently accurate. (f) The commissioner may by rule or otherwise permit the omission of any item of information or document from any registration or notice filing statement. (g) In the case of a nonissuer distribution, information may not be required under section three hundred four of this article or subsection (k) of this section unless it is known to the person filing the registration statement or to the persons on whose behalf the distribution is to be made, or can be furnished by them without unreasonable effort or expense. (h) The commissioner may by rule or order require as a condition of registration by qualification or coordination: (1) That any security issued within the past three years or to be issued to a promoter for a consideration substantially different from the public offering price, or to any person for a consideration other than cash, be deposited in escrow; and (2) that the proceeds from the sale of the registered security in this state be impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the sale of the security either in this state or elsewhere. The commissioner may by rule or order determine the conditions of any escrow or impounding required under this subsection, but he or she may not reject a depository solely because of location in another state.                (i) The commissioner may by rule or order require as a condition of registration that any security registered by qualification or coordination be sold only on a specified form of subscription or sale contract and that a signed or conformed copy of each contract be filed with the commissioner or preserved for any period up to three years specified in the rule or order.(j) Every registration statement is effective for one year from its effective date or any longer period during which the security is being offered or distributed in a nonexempted transaction by or for the account of the issuer or other person on whose behalf the offering is being made or by any underwriter or broker-dealer who is still offering part of an unsold allotment or subscription taken by him or her as a participant in the distribution, except during the time a stop order is in effect under section three hundred six of this article. All outstanding securities of the same class as a registered security are considered to be registered for the purpose of any nonissuer transaction: (1) So long as the registration statement is effective; and (2) between the thirtieth day after the entry of any stop order suspending or revoking the effectiveness of the registration statement under section three hundred six of this article (if the registration statement did not relate, in whole or in part, to a nonissuer distribution) and one year from the effective date of the registration statement. A registration statement may not be withdrawn for one year from its effective date if any securities of the same class are outstanding. A registration statement may be withdrawn otherwise only in the discretion of the commissioner. (k) So long as a registration statement is effective, the commissioner may by rule or order require the person who filed the registration statement to file reports, not more often than quarterly, to keep reasonably current the information contained in the registration statement and to disclose the progress of the offering.(l) A registration statement relating to a security issued by a face amount certificate company or a redeemable security issued by an open-end management company or unit investment trust, as those terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, may be amended after its effective date so as to increase the securities specified as proposed to be offered. The amendment becomes effective when the commissioner so orders. Every person filing an amendment shall pay a filing fee, calculated in the manner specified in subsection (b) of this section, with respect to the additional securities proposed to be offered.(m) Every person changing the name or address of a securities registration or notice filing shall pay a $60 fee for change.(n) Every person amending a registration statement or notice filing or offering a document without increasing the dollar amount registered shall pay a $60 fee for each amended statement, notice filing or document.(o) Every registered issuer or notice filing shall annually file a sales report and shall pay a filing fee for that report of one eighth of one percent of the maximum offering price at which the registered or noticed securities are offered in this state but the fee shall in no case be less than $240 nor more than $1800.(p) Effective July 1, 2025, there shall be an increase in the amount of fees charged by the Commissioner of Securities by the sum of $528 for each offering, amounting to $3,269, creating a total balance of $3,797 for the new fee amount.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to increase fees charged by the Commissioner of Securities.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
