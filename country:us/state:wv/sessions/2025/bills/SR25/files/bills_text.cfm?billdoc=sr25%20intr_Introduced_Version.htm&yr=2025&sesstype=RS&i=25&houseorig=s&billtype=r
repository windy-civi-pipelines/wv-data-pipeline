Red = new code to be enacted SENATE RESOLUTION 25(By Senators Grady and Rucker)[Introduced March 12, 2025] Designating March 13, 2025, as Wear Red Day at the Capitol.Whereas, More than 350,000 people experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital each year, and about 70 percent happen at home with approximately 1 in 10 surviving.  Each year, more than 23,000 children under the age of 18 experience cardiac arrest in the United States, with almost 40 percent of these sports related; and Whereas, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), is critical to increasing a person’s chance of survival if performed immediately.  Statistics show only about 46 percent of people who experience cardiac arrest receive CPR from people nearby while waiting for emergency responders to arrive; andWhereas, To maintain effective solutions to this problem, awareness and education for cardiac emergency plans should be in place, such as CPR education and automated external defibrillator (AED) training and accessibility; andWhereas, Knowing how to properly perform CPR has encouraged more people to act when faced with a cardiac emergency. To save more lives from cardiac arrest outside of a hospital, we must increase the number of people who are trained and can respond to cardiac arrest by calling 911, delivering high-quality CPR and using an AED as soon as it is available; andWhereas, The American Heart Association has set a goal of doubling the survival from cardiac arrest by 2030 by turning bystanders into lifesavers, so that everyone, everywhere is prepared and empowered to become a vital link in the chain of survival and provide CPR in response to a cardiac emergency; and Whereas, In celebration of American Heart Month, we urge every household to join the Nation of Lifesavers™ and learn the critical lifesaving steps of CPR; therefore, be itResolved by the Senate:That the Senate hereby designates March 13, 2025, as Wear Red Day at the Capitol; and, be it Further Resolved, That the Clerk is hereby directed to forward a copy of this resolution to the appropriate representative of the American Heart Association.
