S. C.§1973gg, et seq.).

Any voter designated inactive shall be required to affirm his or her current residence address on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, upon appearing at the polls to vote.(j) In addition to the preceding purging procedures, all counties using the change of address information of the United States Postal Service shall also, once each four years during the period established for systematic purging in the year following a presidential election year, conduct the same procedure by mailing a confirmation notice to those persons not identified as potentially ineligible through the change of address comparison procedure but who have not updated their voter registration records and have not voted in any election during the preceding four two calendar years. The purpose of this additional systematic confirmation procedure shall be to identify those voters who may have moved without filing a forwarding address, moved with a forwarding address under another name, died in a another county or state so that the certificate of death was not returned to the clerk of the county commission, or who otherwise have become ineligible.NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to remove ineligible voters from active voter rolls; remove obsolete reference to combined voter registration and licensing fund; decrease the period of voting inactivity from four to two years; and provide an internal effective date.
