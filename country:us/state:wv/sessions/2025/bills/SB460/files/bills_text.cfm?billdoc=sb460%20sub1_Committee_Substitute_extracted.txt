A number of citizens have religious and moral objections to one or more of the vaccines on the compulsory immunization list contained in this section.  Compulsory immunization forces those West Virginians to choose between their religious belief and their children’s fundamental right to a public education. Forcing West Virginians to vaccinate their children despite their religious and moral objections substantially burdens the free exercise of religion in violation of the Constitutions of the United States and West Virginia and, further, is against the public health policy of this state.NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to create exemptions to mandatory vaccination requirements to accommodate religious conviction or moral grounds.  The bill also revises the existing medical exemption process and eliminates the position of the State Immunization Officer.  The bill permits a civil action for violations of this section.  Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
