(j) Nothing in this section shall, in any way, limit the rights or remedies that are otherwise available to a consumer under any other law. Nor shall this section limit the breeder and purchaser from agreeing between themselves upon terms and conditions that are not inconsistent with this section. However, any agreement or contract by a purchaser to waive any rights provided in this section shall be void and unenforceable. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to specify minimum levels of care to be provided by dog breeders; and to define when a dog is unfit for sale by a dog breeder and provide remedies therefor.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
