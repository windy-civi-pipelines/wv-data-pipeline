Additionally, prior to directing the application of restraints and where there is no threat to the safety of the inmate, the public, staff, or the fetus, the director or designee shall consult with an appropriate health care professional to assure that the manner of restraint will not pose an unreasonable risk of harm to the inmate or the unborn child.(d)(1) Female juveniles committed to the division’s custody shall be provided, at no cost, with feminine hygiene products as soon as practicable upon beginning and during menstruation but, in any case, no less frequent than eight hours after a request is made for the product until menstruation ceases.  For the purposes of this subsection "feminine hygiene products" means tampons and sanitary napkins for use in connection with the menstrual cycle.(2) The terms "feminine hygiene products", "female", and "menstruation" have the same meanings as ascribed to them by the provisions of §28-5c-3.(e) For purposes of implementing the mandates of this section, the director shall enter into any necessary agreements with the Department of Health. An agreement will include, at a minimum, for the direct and incidental costs associated with that care and treatment to be paid by the Division of Juvenile Services. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to require that free feminine hygiene products be provided to female prisoners in all jails, regional jails or state correctional facilities and female juveniles in juvenile detention.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
