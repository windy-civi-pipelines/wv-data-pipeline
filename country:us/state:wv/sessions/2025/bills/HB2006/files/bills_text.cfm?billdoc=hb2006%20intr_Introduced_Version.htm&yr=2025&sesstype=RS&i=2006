Howell, Mazzocchi, Drennan, Moore, Petitto, and White[By Request of the Executive][Introduced February 18, 2025; referred to the Committee on the Judiciary] A BILL to amend the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, by adding thereto a new article, designated §5-32-1, §5-32-2, §5-32-3, §5-32-4, §5-32-5, §5-32-6, §5-32-7, and §5-32-8, relating to clarifying definitions of sex, male, and female in state law and providing for related protections for single-sex spaces.Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia: ARTICLE 32. Sex Definitions and Preservation of Single-Sex Spaces. §5-32-1. Purpose and General Application. (a) The purpose of this article is to:(1) Reaffirm the longstanding meaning of sex, male, and female in state law.(2) Preserve women's restrooms, multiple occupancy restrooms or changing rooms, and sleeping quarters for women in facilities where women have been traditionally afforded privacy and safety from acts of abuse, harassment, sexual assault, and violence committed by men.(3) Bring clarity, certainty, and uniformity to the laws of the state regarding sex discrimination, privacy, equality of the sexes, and benefits or services specifically provided to men and women.(b) This article shall apply wherever the state or an instrumentality of the state classifies people on the basis of sex or otherwise defines people as being female or male, women or men, girls or boys. (c) This article shall not be enforced in any manner inconsistent with or in violation of the ruling in Grimm v. Gloucester School Board, 92 F.3d. 586 (4th Cir. 2020).  If a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States or by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit overrule or otherwise render the Grimm decision ineffective, then the limitations on enforcement imposed by this subsection shall be considered repealed. §5-32-2. Findings. (a) Males and females are legally equal, but they are not the same;(b) Males and females possess unique and immutable biological differences that manifest prior to birth and increase as they age and experience puberty;(c) These unique and immutable biological differences mean that females and males are not similarly situated in all circumstances and are not interchangeable;(d) Inconsistencies in court rulings and policy initiatives regarding sex discrimination and common sex-based words have endangered women's rights and resources and have put the existence of private, single-sex spaces in jeopardy, thereby necessitating clarification of certain terms used in this code.(e) The hard-earned legal equality between men and women is enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, federal laws including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and Sections 1, 10, and 21 of the West Virginia Constitution.(f) In describing equality for women under the Fourteenth Amendment, the U.S. Supreme Court has explained that laws and governmental policies may account for the "enduring" physical differences between the sexes. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996).(g) These physical differences include differences in reproductive anatomy, the basis for separate-sex facilities designed to protect the safety and personal privacy of women and girls. Personal privacy is a natural instinct rooted in biological realities, including the facts that males alone have the biological capability to impregnate women and that males are, on average, physically larger and stronger than women. The state should protect spaces where women have been traditionally afforded privacy and safety from acts of abuse, harassment, sexual assault, and violence committed by men, just as the state should protect women and girls' natural desire to avoid exposing their bodies to males with whom they have limited, if any, relationships. §5-32-3. Definitions of Terms Used in the Code and Code of State Rules. (a) As used in this code and/or any administrative rules, regulations, or public policies adopted by the state or its instrumentalities:(1) A "woman" is an adult human of the female sex, and a "man" is an adult human of the male sex.(2) A "girl" is a human female who is a legal minor, and a "boy" is a human male who is a legal minor: Provided, That the use of the term "girl" or "boy" in reference to the participation of a high-school-aged individual in a school or extracurricular program in accordance with the laws of the state shall not be understood to exclude the participation of a student who is legally an adult.(3) A "mother" is a female parent of a child or children. (4) A "father" is a male parent of a child or children.(5) A "female", when this term is used in reference to a natural person, is an individual who naturally has, had, will have through the course of normal development, or would have but for a developmental anomaly, genetic anomaly, or accident, the reproductive system that at some point produces, transports, and utilizes ova for fertilization.(6) A "male", when this term is used in reference to a natural person, is an individual who naturally has, had, will have through the course of normal development, or would have but for a developmental anomaly, genetic anomaly, or accident, the reproductive system that at some point produces transports, and utilizes sperm for fertilization.(7) "Sex", when this term is used to classify or describe a natural person, means the state of being either male or female as observed or clinically verified at birth.

Sex-based protections permitted and standard of review. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no state or local governmental agency may prohibit distinctions between the sexes with respect to domestic violence shelters, or other accommodation where biology, safety, or privacy are implicated and that result in separate accommodations that are substantially related to the important government interest of protecting the health, safety, and privacy of individuals in such circumstances. §5-32-5.
