Such The rules and regulations shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade or class; but any court of the state other than the Supreme Court of Appeals may adopt rules of court governing its local practice, but such rules of local practice shall not be inconsistent with any general rule of court then in existence or thereafter promulgated, and shall be effective only after approval by the Supreme Court of Appeals.(b) Beginning on July 1, 2025, the Supreme Court of Appeals shall adopt rules that require any circuit judge, judge of the Intermediate Court of Appeals, or justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals, to recuse himself or herself in any proceeding in which a party’s lawyer or the law firm of a party’s lawyer has within the most recent election made aggregate contributions to the judge’s campaign in an amount that is greater than $250.(c) If a judge subject to this section knows or learns by means of timely motion the grounds for the recusal, the judge may ask the parties and their lawyers to consider, outside the presence of the judge and court personnel, whether to waive recusal.
