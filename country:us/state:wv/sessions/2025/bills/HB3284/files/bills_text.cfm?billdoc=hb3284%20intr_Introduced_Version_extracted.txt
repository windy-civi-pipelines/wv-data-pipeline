TAXATION. ARTICLE 21. PERSONAL INCOME TAX. §11-21-27.  Stay in State Tax Credit. (a) Credit allowed.-- To promote the retention of recent in-state college graduates, there is hereby created a tax credit for repayment of student loans against West Virginia personal income tax, available to those individuals that remain in West Virginia following graduation from an accredited West Virginia community college, college, or university.  A qualified individual or an employer of a qualified individual is allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this article in accordance with the provisions of this section.(b) A taxpayer entitled to the credit for any taxable year may carry over and apply to the tax liability for any one or more of the next succeeding 10 years the portion, as reduced from year to year, of any unused credits. (c) A taxpayer may claim a credit based on loan payments actually made to a relevant lender or lenders under this section only with respect to loans that are part of the qualified individual’s financial aid package and, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, only with respect to loan payment amounts paid by the taxpayer during that part of the taxable year that the qualified individual worked in this state. Payment of loan amounts in excess of the amounts due during the taxable year does not qualify for the credit. Refinanced loans that are part of the qualified individual's financial aid package are eligible for the credit under this section if the refinanced loans remain separate from other debt, including debt incurred in an educational program other than the degree program for which a credit is claimed under this section. Forbearance or deferment of loan payments does not affect eligibility for the credit under this section.(d) Except as provided in (g) of this section, the credit under this section may not reduce the tax otherwise due under this part to less than zero.(e) Calculation of the credit.-- The credit with respect to a qualified individual is equal to the amount determined under (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section, whichever is less, multiplied by the proration factor: (1) The benchmark loan payment multiplied by the number of months during the taxable year in which the taxpayer made loan payments; or (2) The monthly loan payment amount multiplied by the number of months during the taxable year in which the taxpayer made loan payments.(f) The credit under (e) of this section for an individual who transferred to an accredited West Virginia community college, college, or university from an accredited non-West Virginia community college, college, or university on or after January 1, 2025, and who earned no more than 30 credit hours of course work toward the degree at an accredited non-West Virginia community college, college, or university is equal to 50 percent of the amount otherwise determined under this section in the case of an associate degree and equal to 75 percent of the amount otherwise determined under this section in the case of a bachelor's degree.(g) Notwithstanding (d) of this section, the credit under this subsection is refundable to the extent the credit is based on loans included in the financial aid package acquired to obtain a bachelor's degree or associate degree in science, technology, engineering or mathematics. For purposes of this subsection, the proration factor is the amount derived by dividing the total number of academic credit hours earned for a bachelor's or associate degree on or after January 1, 2016, by the total number of academic credit hours earned for the bachelor's or associate degree. (h) Employer eligible to the credit.-- An employer may qualify for the credit for a qualified employee.  A taxpayer constituting an employer making loan payments directly to a lender during the taxable year on loans included in a qualified employee's financial aid package may claim a credit equal to the benchmark loan payment or the actual monthly loan payment made by the employer on the loans, whichever is less, multiplied by the number of months during the taxable year the employer made loan payments on behalf of the qualified employee during the term of employment.
