Changes in terminology, organization, or classification of mental health and substance use disorders in future versions of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the World Health Organization’s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems may not affect the conditions covered by this section as long as a condition is commonly understood to be a mental health or substance use disorder by health care providers practicing in relevant clinical specialties."Utilization review" means either of the following:(1) Prospectively, retrospectively, or concurrently reviewing and approving, modifying, delaying, or denying, based in whole or in part on medical necessity, requests by health care providers, insureds, or their authorized representatives for coverage of health care services prior to, retrospectively or concurrent with the provision of health care services to insureds.(2) Evaluating the medical necessity, appropriateness, level of care, service intensity, efficacy, or efficiency of health care services, benefits, procedures, or settings, under any circumstances, to determine whether a health care service or benefit subject to a medical necessity coverage requirement in an insurance policy is covered as medically necessary for an insured."Utilization review criteria" means any criteria, standards, protocols, or guidelines used by an insurer to conduct utilization review. §33-57A-3. Coverage for Medically Necessary Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services.

This section may not be construed to expand or alter the benefits available to the insured or policyholder under an insurance policy.(e) If services for the medically necessary treatment of a mental health or substance use disorder are not available in network within the geographic and timeliness access standards set by law or regulation, the insurer shall arrange coverage to ensure the delivery of medically necessary out-of-network services and any medically necessary follow-up services that, to the maximum extent possible, meet those geographic and timely access standards.

All denials and appeals shall be reviewed by a professional with the same level of education and experience of the provider requesting the authorization.(b) In conducting utilization review of all covered health care services and benefits for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders in children, adolescents, and adults, an insurer shall apply the level of care placement criteria and practice guidelines set forth in the most recent versions of such criteria and practice guidelines, developed by the nonprofit professional association for the relevant clinical specialty.(c) In conducting utilization review involving level of care placement decisions or any other patient care decisions that are within the scope of the sources specified in subsection (b) of this section, an insurer may not apply different, additional, conflicting, or more restrictive utilization review criteria than the criteria and guidelines set forth in those sources.

If that level of placement is not available, the insurer shall authorize the next higher level of care. If there is a disagreement, the insurer shall provide full detail of its scoring using the relevant level of care placement criteria and guidelines as specified in subsection (b) of this section to the provider of the service.(d) To ensure the proper use of the criteria described in subsection (b) of this section, every insurer shall do all of the following:(1) Sponsor a formal education program by nonprofit clinical specialty associations to educate the insurer’s staff, including any third parties contracted with the insurer to review claims, conduct utilization reviews, or make medical necessity determinations about the clinical review criteria.(2) Make the education program available to other stakeholders, including the insurer’s participating providers and covered lives.(3) Provide, at no cost, the clinical review criteria and any training material or resources to providers and insured patients.(4) Track, identify, and analyze how the clinical review criteria are used to certify care, deny care, and support the appeals process.(5) Conduct interrater reliability testing to ensure consistency in utilization review decision making covering how medical necessity decisions are made.

(e) This section applies to all health care services and benefits for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of mental health and substance use disorders covered by an insurance policy, including prescription drugs.(f) This section applies to an insurer that covers hospital, medical, or surgical expenses and conducts utilization review as defined in this section, and any entity or contracting provider that performs utilization review or utilization management functions on an insurer’s behalf.(g) If the commissioner determines that an insurer has violated this section, the commissioner may, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing in accordance with this code, by order, assess a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each violation, or, if a violation was willful, a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each violation. The civil penalties available to the commissioner pursuant to this section are not exclusive and may be sought and employed in combination with any other remedies available to the commissioner under this code.(h) An insurer may not adopt, impose, or enforce terms in its policies or provider agreements, in writing or in operation, that undermine, alter, or conflict with the requirements of this section. §33-57A-5. Discretionary Clauses Prohibited. (a) If an insurer contract offered, issued, delivered, amended, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, contains a provision that reserves discretionary authority to the insurer, or an agent of the insurer, to determine eligibility for benefits or coverage, to interpret the terms of the contract, or to provide standards of interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the laws of this state, that provision is void and unenforceable.(b) For purposes of this section, the term "discretionary authority" means a contract provision that has the effect of conferring discretion on an insurer or other claims administrator determine entitlement to benefits or interpret contract language that, in turn, could lead to a deferential standard of review by a reviewing court.(c) This section does not prohibit an insurer from including a provision in a contract that informs an insured that, as part of its routine operations, the plan applies the terms of its contracts for making decisions, including making determinations regarding eligibility, receipt of benefits and claims, or explaining policies, procedures, and processes, so long as the provision could not give rise to a deferential standard of review by a reviewing court.NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to create the Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders Insurance Coverage Protection Act.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
