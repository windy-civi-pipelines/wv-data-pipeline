Any funding shall be on a reserve basis and converted to a part of the construction grant only after all project budget funds have been secured and all county commitments have been fulfilled. Failure of the county to solidify the project budget and meet its obligations to the state within 18 months of the date the funding is set aside by the authority will result in expiration of the reserve and the funds shall be reallocated by the authority in the succeeding funding cycle.(o) Notwithstanding the provisions of West Virginia Code §18-9D-15 or §18-9D-16, a public charter school may, in its name and sole discretion, submit application to the School Building Authority for funding for costs associated with the renovating, remodeling, purchase or construction of a building to be used for public charter school purposes and for the cost of the project, and the authority may, in its sole discretion, approve such amount of funding as it determines appropriate, in its sole discretion, for such project from monies appropriated to the authority for the benefit of public charter schools. In the event that a public charter school closes, and the public charter school used School Building Authority funding for its building, the building shall be returned to the authorizer, as defined in §18-5G-2 of this code, for purposes of ownership. If the building cannot be returned to the authorizer, the building shall be returned to the state. Additionally, if School Building Authority funds were used to improve an existing property, the School Building Authority is authorized to develop a formula to determine the monetary amount of improvements to be returned to either the authorizer or the state.(p) The Local School Improvement Council ("LSIC") of any public school in this state may act independently of a local education authority, including but not limited to the county board, to submit an application for funding to address any deferred maintenance concerns of a school: Provided, That the deferred maintenance cost to bring the facility up to current as expressed in the Comprehensive Educational Facilities Plan exceeds 25% of the School Building Authority's estimated cost of replacement for the facility, and the LSIC finds that the local education authority has not taken sufficient action to address the facility needs of the school.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to provide for the creation of the "Support for Neglected Schools Act."

Failure of the county to solidify the project budget and meet its obligations to the state within 18 months of the date the funding is set aside by the authority will result in expiration of the reserve and the funds shall be reallocated by the authority in the succeeding funding cycle.(o) Notwithstanding the provisions of West Virginia Code §18-9D-15 or §18-9D-16, a public charter school may, in its name and sole discretion, submit application to the School Building Authority for funding for costs associated with the renovating, remodeling, purchase or construction of a building to be used for public charter school purposes and for the cost of the project, and the authority may, in its sole discretion, approve such amount of funding as it determines appropriate, in its sole discretion, for such project from monies appropriated to the authority for the benefit of public charter schools. In the event that a public charter school closes, and the public charter school used School Building Authority funding for its building, the building shall be returned to the authorizer, as defined in §18-5G-2 of this code, for purposes of ownership. If the building cannot be returned to the authorizer, the building shall be returned to the state. Additionally, if School Building Authority funds were used to improve an existing property, the School Building Authority is authorized to develop a formula to determine the monetary amount of improvements to be returned to either the authorizer or the state.(p) The Local School Improvement Council ("LSIC") of any public school in this state may act independently of a local education authority, including but not limited to the county board, to submit an application for funding to address any deferred maintenance concerns of a school: Provided, That the deferred maintenance cost to bring the facility up to current as expressed in the Comprehensive Educational Facilities Plan exceeds 25% of the School Building Authority's estimated cost of replacement for the facility, and the LSIC finds that the local education authority has not taken sufficient action to address the facility needs of the school.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to provide for the creation of the "Support for Neglected Schools Act."
