In order to address the intent of the Legislature contained in this subsection, the authority shall grant preference to those projects which involve multicounty arrangements as the authority shall determine reasonable and proper.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(m) County boards shall submit all designs for construction of new school buildings to the School Building Authority for review and approval prior to preparation of final bid documents.

Any funding shall be on a reserve basis and converted to a part of the construction grant only after all project budget funds have been secured and all county commitments have been fulfilled. Failure of the county to solidify the project budget and meet its obligations to the state within 18 months of the date the funding is set aside by the authority will result in expiration of the reserve and the funds shall be reallocated by the authority in the succeeding funding cycle.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(o) Notwithstanding the provisions of West Virginia Code &sect;18-9D-15 or &sect;18-9D-16, a public charter school may, in its name and sole discretion, submit application to the School Building Authority for funding for costs associated with the renovating, remodeling, purchase or construction of a building to be used for public charter school purposes and for the cost of the project, and the authority may, in its sole discretion, approve such amount of funding as it determines appropriate, in its sole discretion, for such project from monies appropriated to the authority for the benefit of public charter schools.
