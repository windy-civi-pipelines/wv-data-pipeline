(a) Findings and purpose. — The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:(1) Data centers represent a significant and growing sector of the economy, generating substantial economic activity, including jobs, infrastructure investments, and technological innovation. (2) Data centers are critical national infrastructure that require abundant, low-cost energy to protect sensitive data, operate high-level computation assets, and ensure the resilience of the digital economy.(3) The People’s Republic of China is positioning itself to be the global leader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of data toward China instead of toward the United States.(4) It is in the United States’ national security interests to limit the flow of data to China and to protect the flow of data and maximize computational power inside the United States.  The President has declared that it is the policy of the United States "to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness and national security."  Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, Executive Order 14179 (Jan 23, 2025).(5) As of early 2025, the highest concentration of high-level computational power and data centers in the world is located in Loudoun County, Virginia. This severe concentration of data centers in one location is a national security vulnerability because it invites the potential for cyberattacks and espionage against the Nation’s critical data infrastructure.(6) Data centers have historically obtained their electricity from the electric grid.  Some data center developers now seek or require the use of microgrids to provide their primary and backup power.(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the United States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to Washington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the majority of the Nation’s population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the least restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of abundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; and (F) its skilled and loyal workforce that has some of the lowest turnover rates in the Nation. As such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development and expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic growth.  The Legislature finds that these externalities transcend local borders, including environmental concerns, energy consumption, and regional economic growth.  Additionally, the provisions in this section align with the Legislature’s goal of fostering a competitive, forward-thinking economy that benefits all residents.(b) Program established. — The High Impact Data Center Program is hereby created and is to be administered as a program within the Division of Economic Development to encourage the continued development, construction, operation, maintenance, and expansion in West Virginia of high impact data centers. In order to effectuate the purposes of this section, the Division of Economic Development, or any agency, division, or subdivision thereof, may promulgate legislative rules, including emergency rules, in accordance with §29A-3-1 et seq. of this code.(c) Notification. — Any data center shall compare its current or planned operations against the definition of "high impact data center" established in §11-6N-2 of this code and provide notification to the Division of Economic Development when the data center becomes aware that it will satisfy or has satisfied that definition.  The notification will include information addressing the elements of that definition, including known or expected power consumption of the data center.  This notification shall be made (1) within 30 days after the data center determines that it meets these requirements, or (2) when the data center reasonably anticipates that it will, at some future date, meet these requirements, in which case the data center may provide that anticipated future date in its notification.(d) Certification. — The Secretary of the Department of Commerce shall identify and certify high impact data centers in this state upon a finding that a data center satisfies the requirements for the definition of "high impact data center" set forth in §11-6N-2 of this code.  The Secretary shall issue confirmation of certification to a high impact data center within 14 days following receipt of the notification from the data center required by this section. (e) Recordkeeping. — Any information provided by a data center pursuant to this section that is identified by the data center as confidential business information shall be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.  The Secretary shall take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary shall maintain a complete list of all certified high impact data centers and all relevant information that can be made available to the Governor and Legislature, removing specifically identifying information to ensure confidentiality of any such information as identified by any high impact data center. §5B-2-21b. Authority to assist certified microgrid district projects and certified high impact data center projects; legislative findings. (a) Findings and purpose. — The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:(1) Data centers represent a significant and growing sector of the economy, generating substantial economic activity, including jobs, infrastructure investments, and technological innovation. (2) Data centers are critical national infrastructure that require abundant, low-cost energy to protect sensitive data, operate high-level computation assets, and ensure the resilience of the digital economy.(3) The People’s Republic of China is positioning itself to be the global leader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of data toward China instead of toward the United States.(4) It is in the United States’ national security interests to limit the flow of data to China and to protect the flow of data and maximize computational power inside the United States.  The President has declared that it is the policy of the United States "to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness and national security."  Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, Executive Order 14179 (Jan 23, 2025).(5) As of early 2025, the highest concentration of high-level computational power and data centers in the world is located in Loudoun County, Virginia. This severe concentration of data centers in one location is a national security vulnerability because it invites the potential for cyberattacks and espionage against the Nation’s critical data infrastructure.(6) Data centers have historically obtained their electricity from the electric grid.  Some data center developers now seek or require the use of microgrids to provide their primary and backup power.(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the United States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to Washington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the majority of the Nation’s population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the least restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of abundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; and (F) its skilled and loyal workforce that has some of the lowest turnover rates in the Nation.As such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development and expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic growth.  The Legislature finds that these externalities transcend local borders, including environmental concerns, energy consumption, and regional economic growth.  It is in the best interest of the state to induce and assist in development of these projects, in order to advance the public purposes of relieving unemployment by preserving and creating jobs, and preserving and creating new and greater sources of revenues for the support of public services provided by the state and local government. Additionally, the provisions in this section align with the Legislature’s goal of fostering a competitive, forward-thinking economy that benefits all residents.It is the intent of the Legislature to occupy the whole field of the creation and regulation of certified microgrid districts and certified high impact data centers. The stated purpose of this section is to promote uniform and consistent application of the act within the state.(b) The Department of Commerce shall assist projects developing or operating a certified microgrid district pursuant to §5B-2-21 of this code or a certified high impact data center pursuant to §5B-2-21a of this code.  The Secretary of Commerce shall designate one of their personnel as "Data Economy Liaison" to serve as a single point-of-contact for certified microgrid districts and high impact data centers to assist coordinate and expedite their development and operation, including, but not limited to site selection and permitting.  A "certified microgrid district" is a microgrid project, regardless of stage of development or operation, that has been certified by the Secretary of the Department of Commerce as set forth in §5B-2-21 of this code.  A "certified high impact data center" is a data center project, regardless of stage of development or operation, that has been certified by the Secretary of the Department of Commerce as set forth in §5B-2-21a of this code.  (c) This section prohibits:(1) Counties and municipalities, whether by ordinance, resolution, administrative act, or otherwise, from enacting, adopting, implementing, or enforcing ordinances, regulations, or rules which limit, in any way, the creation of, and acquisition, construction, equipping, development, expansion, and operation of any certified microgrid district or certified high impact data center project;

(2) Data centers are critical national infrastructure that require abundant, low-cost energy to protect sensitive data, operate high-level computation assets, and ensure the resilience of the digital economy.(3) The People’s Republic of China is positioning itself to be the global leader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of data toward China instead of toward the United States.(4) It is in the United States’ national security interests to limit the flow of data to China and to protect the flow of data and maximize computational power inside the United States.  The President has declared that it is the policy of the United States "to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness and national security."  Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, Executive Order 14179 (Jan 23, 2025).(5) As of early 2025, the highest concentration of high-level computational power and data centers in the world is located across the West Virginia border in Loudoun County, Virginia. This severe concentration of data centers in one location is a national security vulnerability because it invites the potential for cyberattacks and espionage against the Nation’s critical data infrastructure.(6) Data centers have historically obtained their electricity from the electric grid.  Some data center developers now seek or require the use of microgrids to provide their primary and backup power.(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the United States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to Washington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the majority of the Nation’s population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the least restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of abundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; and (F) a skilled and loyal workforce that has some of the lowest turnover rates in the Nation.As such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development and expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic growth.  The Legislature find that these externalities transcend local borders, including environmental concerns, energy consumption, and regional economic growth.  Additionally, the provisions in this article aligns with the Legislature’s goal of fostering a competitive, forward-thinking economy that benefits all residents. §11-6N-2.

CHAPTER 24. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION. ARTICLE 2. POWERS AND DUTIES OF PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION. §24-2-1d. Future electric generating capacity requirements. (a) In order to maximize the use of electricity generated within the state by using coal or natural gas produced within the state, the Public Service Commission shall by order, no later than December 31, 1989, establish the schedule and amount of future electric generating capacity additions required by each West Virginia electric utility, for the next ten years, taking into account: (1) Projected load growth; (2) existing generating capacity; (3) capacity factors for existing generation; (4) existing contractual commitments to sell or purchase capacity; (5) planned retirement and life extensions of existing capacity; (6) planned construction of capacity; (7) availability of capacity from generating units of affiliated companies; and (8) such other reasonable factors as the commission may deem relevant and appropriate to consider. For purposes of this section, "capacity factor" shall mean the ratio of the actual energy produced by a power plant over a specific period to the maximum possible energy it could have produced if running at full capacity during that same period.(b) If the commission determines after considering all such named and other relevant and appropriate factors that a utility will be required to purchase electric generating capacity beyond those agreements approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the West Virginia Public Service Commission in order to serve its West Virginia customers, the amount of such required additional purchased capacity so identified by the commission will for purposes of this section be referred to as the utility's "projected deficient capacity": Provided, That this subsection shall not include power generating facilities whose total production of electricity is sold outside the State of West Virginia.(c) In the interests of: Keeping utility rates of residential customers as low as possible; keeping utility rates for commercial and industrial customers competitive with those of other states; attracting new industry for which electric power costs are a major factor in location determinations; and of not placing any greater cost burden on government than is absolutely necessary for its electric power needs, each utility shall acquire, if reasonable, its projected deficient capacity from electric generation situated in West Virginia which burns coal or gas produced in West Virginia and which will provide the most reliable supply of capacity and energy at the least cost to those customers of the utility who will be served by such electric generation: Provided, That all power purchase contracts executed prior to the effective date of this section which satisfy the following requirements, regardless of location, shall be considered, for the purposes of this subsection, as electric generation situated in West Virginia: (1) Said contracts were negotiated in accordance with procedures and priced according to methodologies of other contracts which the commission has ordered approved; (2) said contracts either guarantee or are substantially amended to guarantee for the life of the contract the use of an amount of West Virginia fuel which equals or exceeds the amount which would be required, on a percentage of output basis, to produce the amount of electric power to be consumed in West Virginia; and (3) said contracts meet the requirements for a qualifying facility established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.(d) The commission shall evaluate each capacity auction conducted by PJM Interconnection, LLC, or its successor and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, encourage the coordination of the voluntary participation of every electric generating unit in the state in each capacity auction for the benefit of ratepayers in the state.(e) In order to ensure the state’s existing generating units can continue to meet future generation needs, the commission shall conduct a review of each generating unit’s current consumer economic dispatch. Factors to be considered by the commission in reviewing consumer economic dispatch shall include, but not be limited to: (1) current capacity factors; (2) management of fuel supplies and contracts; (3) overall plant operation and maintenance; (4) placement of bids in the PJM Interconnection, LLC, or its successor’s day-ahead and real-time energy markets; (5) utilization of the PJM Interconnection, LLC, or its successor’s Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) or Fixed Resource Requirement (FRR); and (6) the utilization of automatic adjustment clauses, price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses by the utilities.  For purposes of this section, "consumer economic dispatch" shall mean the process of operating generation facilities to produce electricity at the lowest cost while reliably meeting consumer demand, considering the operational limits of generation and transmission facilities.(f) Electric utilities shall be prepared to maximize the production of electricity from their generating units when such self-generation will result in reduced energy costs for West Virginia ratepayers.  The commission shall require the utilities to maintain their thermal baseload generating units in a manner to allow them to be able to self-generate and achieve at least a sixty-nine percent capacity factor.  Nothing herein shall require a utility to operate a generating unit at a sixty-nine percent capacity if doing so will cause an increase in the charge or charges for electric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll or schedule.  The commission shall promulgate rules as necessary to carry out its duties and obligations as set forth herein. §24-2-1q. Base fuel coal supply requirements for electric grid resiliency. Recognizing that coal inventories at coal-fired power plants may increase and decrease over time Any coal-fired power plant owned by a public electric utility as of the effective date of this section shall, in order to ensure grid resiliency and homeland security, each generating public utility shall plan incoming and outgoing coal so as to maintain an average annual minimum 30-day aggregate coal supply on site at each coal-fired power plant under contract for the remainder of the life of those plants. The commission may promulgate rules as necessary to carry out its duties and obligations as set forth herein. §24-2-15. Certain automatic Automatic adjustment clauses, price indexes or fuel adjustment clauses prohibited. The commission shall not enforce, originate, continue, establish, change or otherwise authorize or permit an increase in the charge or charges for electric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll or schedule as the result ofthrough any automatic adjustment clause, fuel supply price index or fuel adjustment clause. Automatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses that do not create a net increase in the charge or charges for electric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll, or schedule shall be permitted by the commission. For purposes of this section, a "net increase" in the charge or charges for electric service shall mean that for the calendar year in which the automatic adjustment clause, fuel supply contract price index, or fuel adjustment clause is utilized, the average charge or charges for electric energy are higher than they would have been if the adjustment clause, fuel supply contract price index, or fuel adjustment clause were not utilized.  The commission shall encourage the use of permitted automatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses as a means of increasing the generation of coal-fired power plants within the state.  The Commission shall promulgate procedural rules governing the utilization of automatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, and fuel adjustment clauses. §24-2-19. Integrated Resource Planning Required. (a) Not later than March 31, 2015, the Public Service Commission shall issue an order directing any electric utility that does not have an existing requirement approved by the Public Service Commission that provides for the future review of both supply side and demand side resources to develop an initial integrated resource plan to be filed not later than January 1, 2016, in conjunction with other similar deadlines required by other states or entities of the electric utilities. This order may include guidelines for developing an integrated resource plan.(b)(1) Any electric utility that has an existing requirement approved by the Public Service Commission that provides for the future review of both supply side and demand side resources is exempt from this initial integrated resource plan filing until such time as that existing requirement has been satisfied. Thereafter, such electric utility is required to file an integrated resource plan pursuant to §24-2-19(a) of this code.(2) Each electric utility that has filed the initial integrated resource plan shall file an updated plan at least every five years after the initial integrated resource plan has been filed. Any electric utility that was exempt from filing an initial integrated resource plan shall file an integrated resource plan within five years of satisfying any existing requirement and at least every five years thereafter. All integrated resource plans shall comply with the provisions of any relevant order of the Public Service Commission establishing guidelines for the format and contents of updated and revised integrated resource plans.(c) The Public Service Commission shall analyze and review an integrated resource plan. The Public Service Commission may request further information from the utility, as necessary. Nothing in this section affects the obligations of utilities to obtain otherwise applicable commission approvals.(d) The Commission may consider both supply-side and demand-side resources when developing the requirements for the integrated resource plans. The plan shall compare projected peak demands with current and planned capacity resources in order to develop a portfolio of resources that represents a reasonable balance of cost and risk for the utility and its customers in meeting future demand for the provision of adequate and reliable service to its electric customers as specified by the Public Service Commission.(e) The commission shall by order, entered no later than July 1, 2025, require all electric utilities operating in the state to supplement their existing integrated resource plans to include a detailed plant upgrade and maintenance plan, improvement compliance schedule, and cost estimate for ensuring the operation of each generating unit through their planned retirement date.  The supplemental integrated resource plan shall also include an analysis of the action necessary to extend the life of each generating unit beyond their planned retirement date. Subject to notice and comment from interested parties, the commission may approve the supplemental integrated resource plan without modification or require modification of the supplemental plan before it is approved. The commission shall promulgate rules requiring the supplementation of integrated resource plans as required by this provision. The rules shall also provide a procedure for utilities to submit an independent evaluation of any modification required by the commission hereunder or to challenge such required modification.

(a) Findings and purpose. — The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:(1) Data centers represent a significant and growing sector of the economy, generating substantial economic activity, including jobs, infrastructure investments, and technological innovation. (2) Data centers are critical national infrastructure that require abundant, low-cost energy to protect sensitive data, operate high-level computation assets, and ensure the resilience of the digital economy.(3) The People’s Republic of China is positioning itself to be the global leader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of data toward China instead of toward the United States.(4) It is in the United States’ national security interests to limit the flow of data to China and to protect the flow of data and maximize computational power inside the United States.  The President has declared that it is the policy of the United States "to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness and national security."  Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, Executive Order 14179 (Jan 23, 2025).(5) As of early 2025, the highest concentration of high-level computational power and data centers in the world is located in Loudoun County, Virginia. This severe concentration of data centers in one location is a national security vulnerability because it invites the potential for cyberattacks and espionage against the Nation’s critical data infrastructure.(6) Data centers have historically obtained their electricity from the electric grid.  Some data center developers now seek or require the use of microgrids to provide their primary and backup power.(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the United States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to Washington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the majority of the Nation’s population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the least restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of abundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; and (F) its skilled and loyal workforce that has some of the lowest turnover rates in the Nation. As such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development and expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic growth.  The Legislature finds that these externalities transcend local borders, including environmental concerns, energy consumption, and regional economic growth.  Additionally, the provisions in this section align with the Legislature’s goal of fostering a competitive, forward-thinking economy that benefits all residents.(b) Program established. — The High Impact Data Center Program is hereby created and is to be administered as a program within the Division of Economic Development to encourage the continued development, construction, operation, maintenance, and expansion in West Virginia of high impact data centers. In order to effectuate the purposes of this section, the Division of Economic Development, or any agency, division, or subdivision thereof, may promulgate legislative rules, including emergency rules, in accordance with §29A-3-1 et seq. of this code.(c) Notification. — Any data center shall compare its current or planned operations against the definition of "high impact data center" established in §11-6N-2 of this code and provide notification to the Division of Economic Development when the data center becomes aware that it will satisfy or has satisfied that definition.  The notification will include information addressing the elements of that definition, including known or expected power consumption of the data center.  This notification shall be made (1) within 30 days after the data center determines that it meets these requirements, or (2) when the data center reasonably anticipates that it will, at some future date, meet these requirements, in which case the data center may provide that anticipated future date in its notification.(d) Certification. — The Secretary of the Department of Commerce shall identify and certify high impact data centers in this state upon a finding that a data center satisfies the requirements for the definition of "high impact data center" set forth in §11-6N-2 of this code.  The Secretary shall issue confirmation of certification to a high impact data center within 14 days following receipt of the notification from the data center required by this section. (e) Recordkeeping. — Any information provided by a data center pursuant to this section that is identified by the data center as confidential business information shall be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.  The Secretary shall take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary shall maintain a complete list of all certified high impact data centers and all relevant information that can be made available to the Governor and Legislature, removing specifically identifying information to ensure confidentiality of any such information as identified by any high impact data center. §5B-2-21b. Authority to assist certified microgrid district projects and certified high impact data center projects; legislative findings. (a) Findings and purpose. — The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:(1) Data centers represent a significant and growing sector of the economy, generating substantial economic activity, including jobs, infrastructure investments, and technological innovation. (2) Data centers are critical national infrastructure that require abundant, low-cost energy to protect sensitive data, operate high-level computation assets, and ensure the resilience of the digital economy.(3) The People’s Republic of China is positioning itself to be the global leader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of data toward China instead of toward the United States.(4) It is in the United States’ national security interests to limit the flow of data to China and to protect the flow of data and maximize computational power inside the United States.  The President has declared that it is the policy of the United States "to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness and national security."  Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, Executive Order 14179 (Jan 23, 2025).(5) As of early 2025, the highest concentration of high-level computational power and data centers in the world is located in Loudoun County, Virginia.

CHAPTER 11. TAXATION. ARTICLE 6N. SPECIAL METHOD FOR VALUATION OF CERTAIN HIGH-TECHNOLOGY PROPERTY. §11-6N-1. Legislative findings and purpose. The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:(1) Data centers represent a significant and growing sector of the economy, generating substantial economic activity, including jobs, infrastructure investments, and technological innovation. (2) Data centers are critical national infrastructure that require abundant, low-cost energy to protect sensitive data, operate high-level computation assets, and ensure the resilience of the digital economy.(3) The People’s Republic of China is positioning itself to be the global leader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of data toward China instead of toward the United States.(4) It is in the United States’ national security interests to limit the flow of data to China and to protect the flow of data and maximize computational power inside the United States.  The President has declared that it is the policy of the United States "to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness and national security."  Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, Executive Order 14179 (Jan 23, 2025).(5) As of early 2025, the highest concentration of high-level computational power and data centers in the world is located across the West Virginia border in Loudoun County, Virginia. This severe concentration of data centers in one location is a national security vulnerability because it invites the potential for cyberattacks and espionage against the Nation’s critical data infrastructure.(6) Data centers have historically obtained their electricity from the electric grid.  Some data center developers now seek or require the use of microgrids to provide their primary and backup power.(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the United States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to Washington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the majority of the Nation’s population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the least restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of abundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; and (F) a skilled and loyal workforce that has some of the lowest turnover rates in the Nation.As such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development and expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic growth.  The Legislature find that these externalities transcend local borders, including environmental concerns, energy consumption, and regional economic growth.  Additionally, the provisions in this article aligns with the Legislature’s goal of fostering a competitive, forward-thinking economy that benefits all residents. §11-6N-2.

CHAPTER 24. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION. ARTICLE 2. POWERS AND DUTIES OF PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION. §24-2-1d. Future electric generating capacity requirements. (a) In order to maximize the use of electricity generated within the state by using coal or natural gas produced within the state, the Public Service Commission shall by order, no later than December 31, 1989, establish the schedule and amount of future electric generating capacity additions required by each West Virginia electric utility, for the next ten years, taking into account: (1) Projected load growth; (2) existing generating capacity; (3) capacity factors for existing generation; (4) existing contractual commitments to sell or purchase capacity; (5) planned retirement and life extensions of existing capacity; (6) planned construction of capacity; (7) availability of capacity from generating units of affiliated companies; and (8) such other reasonable factors as the commission may deem relevant and appropriate to consider. For purposes of this section, "capacity factor" shall mean the ratio of the actual energy produced by a power plant over a specific period to the maximum possible energy it could have produced if running at full capacity during that same period.(b) If the commission determines after considering all such named and other relevant and appropriate factors that a utility will be required to purchase electric generating capacity beyond those agreements approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the West Virginia Public Service Commission in order to serve its West Virginia customers, the amount of such required additional purchased capacity so identified by the commission will for purposes of this section be referred to as the utility's "projected deficient capacity": Provided, That this subsection shall not include power generating facilities whose total production of electricity is sold outside the State of West Virginia.(c) In the interests of: Keeping utility rates of residential customers as low as possible; keeping utility rates for commercial and industrial customers competitive with those of other states; attracting new industry for which electric power costs are a major factor in location determinations; and of not placing any greater cost burden on government than is absolutely necessary for its electric power needs, each utility shall acquire, if reasonable, its projected deficient capacity from electric generation situated in West Virginia which burns coal or gas produced in West Virginia and which will provide the most reliable supply of capacity and energy at the least cost to those customers of the utility who will be served by such electric generation: Provided, That all power purchase contracts executed prior to the effective date of this section which satisfy the following requirements, regardless of location, shall be considered, for the purposes of this subsection, as electric generation situated in West Virginia: (1) Said contracts were negotiated in accordance with procedures and priced according to methodologies of other contracts which the commission has ordered approved; (2) said contracts either guarantee or are substantially amended to guarantee for the life of the contract the use of an amount of West Virginia fuel which equals or exceeds the amount which would be required, on a percentage of output basis, to produce the amount of electric power to be consumed in West Virginia; and (3) said contracts meet the requirements for a qualifying facility established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.(d) The commission shall evaluate each capacity auction conducted by PJM Interconnection, LLC, or its successor and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, encourage the coordination of the voluntary participation of every electric generating unit in the state in each capacity auction for the benefit of ratepayers in the state.(e) In order to ensure the state’s existing generating units can continue to meet future generation needs, the commission shall conduct a review of each generating unit’s current consumer economic dispatch. Factors to be considered by the commission in reviewing consumer economic dispatch shall include, but not be limited to: (1) current capacity factors; (2) management of fuel supplies and contracts; (3) overall plant operation and maintenance; (4) placement of bids in the PJM Interconnection, LLC, or its successor’s day-ahead and real-time energy markets; (5) utilization of the PJM Interconnection, LLC, or its successor’s Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) or Fixed Resource Requirement (FRR); and (6) the utilization of automatic adjustment clauses, price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses by the utilities.  For purposes of this section, "consumer economic dispatch" shall mean the process of operating generation facilities to produce electricity at the lowest cost while reliably meeting consumer demand, considering the operational limits of generation and transmission facilities.(f) Electric utilities shall be prepared to maximize the production of electricity from their generating units when such self-generation will result in reduced energy costs for West Virginia ratepayers.  The commission shall require the utilities to maintain their thermal baseload generating units in a manner to allow them to be able to self-generate and achieve at least a sixty-nine percent capacity factor.  Nothing herein shall require a utility to operate a generating unit at a sixty-nine percent capacity if doing so will cause an increase in the charge or charges for electric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll or schedule.  The commission shall promulgate rules as necessary to carry out its duties and obligations as set forth herein. §24-2-1q. Base fuel coal supply requirements for electric grid resiliency. Recognizing that coal inventories at coal-fired power plants may increase and decrease over time Any coal-fired power plant owned by a public electric utility as of the effective date of this section shall, in order to ensure grid resiliency and homeland security, each generating public utility shall plan incoming and outgoing coal so as to maintain an average annual minimum 30-day aggregate coal supply on site at each coal-fired power plant under contract for the remainder of the life of those plants. The commission may promulgate rules as necessary to carry out its duties and obligations as set forth herein. §24-2-15. Certain automatic Automatic adjustment clauses, price indexes or fuel adjustment clauses prohibited. The commission shall not enforce, originate, continue, establish, change or otherwise authorize or permit an increase in the charge or charges for electric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll or schedule as the result ofthrough any automatic adjustment clause, fuel supply price index or fuel adjustment clause. Automatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses that do not create a net increase in the charge or charges for electric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll, or schedule shall be permitted by the commission. For purposes of this section, a "net increase" in the charge or charges for electric service shall mean that for the calendar year in which the automatic adjustment clause, fuel supply contract price index, or fuel adjustment clause is utilized, the average charge or charges for electric energy are higher than they would have been if the adjustment clause, fuel supply contract price index, or fuel adjustment clause were not utilized.  The commission shall encourage the use of permitted automatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses as a means of increasing the generation of coal-fired power plants within the state.  The Commission shall promulgate procedural rules governing the utilization of automatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, and fuel adjustment clauses. §24-2-19. Integrated Resource Planning Required. (a) Not later than March 31, 2015, the Public Service Commission shall issue an order directing any electric utility that does not have an existing requirement approved by the Public Service Commission that provides for the future review of both supply side and demand side resources to develop an initial integrated resource plan to be filed not later than January 1, 2016, in conjunction with other similar deadlines required by other states or entities of the electric utilities. This order may include guidelines for developing an integrated resource plan.(b)(1) Any electric utility that has an existing requirement approved by the Public Service Commission that provides for the future review of both supply side and demand side resources is exempt from this initial integrated resource plan filing until such time as that existing requirement has been satisfied. Thereafter, such electric utility is required to file an integrated resource plan pursuant to §24-2-19(a) of this code.(2) Each electric utility that has filed the initial integrated resource plan shall file an updated plan at least every five years after the initial integrated resource plan has been filed. Any electric utility that was exempt from filing an initial integrated resource plan shall file an integrated resource plan within five years of satisfying any existing requirement and at least every five years thereafter. All integrated resource plans shall comply with the provisions of any relevant order of the Public Service Commission establishing guidelines for the format and contents of updated and revised integrated resource plans.(c) The Public Service Commission shall analyze and review an integrated resource plan. The Public Service Commission may request further information from the utility, as necessary. Nothing in this section affects the obligations of utilities to obtain otherwise applicable commission approvals.(d) The Commission may consider both supply-side and demand-side resources when developing the requirements for the integrated resource plans. The plan shall compare projected peak demands with current and planned capacity resources in order to develop a portfolio of resources that represents a reasonable balance of cost and risk for the utility and its customers in meeting future demand for the provision of adequate and reliable service to its electric customers as specified by the Public Service Commission.(e) The commission shall by order, entered no later than July 1, 2025, require all electric utilities operating in the state to supplement their existing integrated resource plans to include a detailed plant upgrade and maintenance plan, improvement compliance schedule, and cost estimate for ensuring the operation of each generating unit through their planned retirement date.  The supplemental integrated resource plan shall also include an analysis of the action necessary to extend the life of each generating unit beyond their planned retirement date. Subject to notice and comment from interested parties, the commission may approve the supplemental integrated resource plan without modification or require modification of the supplemental plan before it is approved. The commission shall promulgate rules requiring the supplementation of integrated resource plans as required by this provision. The rules shall also provide a procedure for utilities to submit an independent evaluation of any modification required by the commission hereunder or to challenge such required modification.
