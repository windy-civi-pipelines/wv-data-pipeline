This severe concentration of data centers in one location is a national security vulnerability because it invites the potential for cyberattacks and espionage against the Nation&rsquo;s critical data infrastructure.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(6) Data centers have historically obtained their electricity from the electric grid. &nbsp;Some data center developers now seek or require the use of microgrids to provide their primary and backup power.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the United States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to Washington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the majority of the Nation&rsquo;s population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the least restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of abundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; and (F) a skilled and loyal workforce that has some of the lowest turnover rates in the Nation.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">As such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development and expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic growth. &nbsp;The Legislature find that these externalities transcend local borders, including environmental concerns, energy consumption, and regional economic growth. &nbsp;Additionally, the provisions in this article aligns with the Legislature&rsquo;s goal of fostering a competitive, forward-thinking economy that benefits all residents.</span></p><h4 class="csCA36641A">
