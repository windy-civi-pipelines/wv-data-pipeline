Ventilation and fire suppression for limited use food preparation facilities. (a) Legislative findings. – The Legislature finds that rules governing commercial food preparation in restaurants have unfairly impacted limited use food preparation facilities in this state such as county fair food booths, church and non-profit food vendors, volunteer fire department kitchens, and other limited use food preparation areas. Presently, these organizations must abide by very stringent fire codes for food preparation. Specifically, to abide by existing code, these facilities must invest in costly "hoods'' with certain air flow requirements and automatic fire suppression over frying equipment.
