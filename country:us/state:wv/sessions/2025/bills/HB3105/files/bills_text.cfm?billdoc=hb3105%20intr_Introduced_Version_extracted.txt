The membership of any person in the plan ceases: (1) Upon the withdrawal of accumulated contributions after the cessation of service; (2) upon retirement; (3) at death; or (4) upon the date, if any, when after the cessation of service, the outstanding balance of any loan obtained by the member pursuant to §7-14D-23 of this code, plus accrued interest, equals or exceeds the accumulated contributions of the member.(b) Any deputy sheriff employed in covered employment on the effective date of this article shall within six months of that effective date notify in writing both the county commission in the county in which he or she is employed and the board, of his or her desire to become a member of the plan: Provided, That this time period is extended to January 30, 1999, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals in West Virginia Deputy Sheriffs' Association, et al v.

For purposes of this subsection, the member's years of service and credited service in the Public Employees Retirement System prior to the effective date of this article shall not be counted for any purposes under this plan unless: (1) The deputy sheriff has not received the return of his or her accumulated contributions in the Public Employees Retirement System pursuant to §5-10-30 of this code; or (2) the accumulated contributions returned to the member from the Public Employees Retirement System have been repaid pursuant to §7-14D-13 of this code.  If the conditions of subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection are met, all years of the deputy sheriff's covered employment shall be counted as years of service for the purposes of this article.(e) Once made, the election provided in this section is irrevocable.

If a question arises regarding the status of an individual as a leased employee, the board has final power to decide the question.(g) Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, a deputy sheriff may retire after 20 years of honorable and actual service, with full benefits under the provisions of §7-14D-1 et seq. The West Virginia Deputy Sheriffs Retirement System shall propose rules for legislative approval in accordance with §29A-3-1 et seq. designed to implement this subsection.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to permit deputy sheriffs to retire after 20 years of honorable and actual service, with full benefits.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
