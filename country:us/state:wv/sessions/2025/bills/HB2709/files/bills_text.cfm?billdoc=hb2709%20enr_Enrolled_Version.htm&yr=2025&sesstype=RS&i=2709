The voter shall be permitted to vote as follows:(1) The voter may cast a challenged or provisional ballot at the new polling place if the voter's registration is found on the registration records within the county during the canvass and no other challenge of eligibility was entered on election day, the challenge shall be removed and the ballot shall be counted;(2) During the early in-person voting period, the voter may vote in the precinct serving their new address without casting a provisional ballot if the voter shows proof of new address and the change is completed in the state-wide voter registration system by the county clerk prior to canvass.(d) A voter whose registration record has been placed on an inactive status or transferred to an inactive file and who has not responded to a confirmation notice sent pursuant to the provisions of section 24, 25, or 26 of this article and who offers to vote at the polling place where he or she is registered to vote shall be required to affirm his or her present residence address under penalty of perjury, as provided in section 36 of this article.ARTICLE 3.
