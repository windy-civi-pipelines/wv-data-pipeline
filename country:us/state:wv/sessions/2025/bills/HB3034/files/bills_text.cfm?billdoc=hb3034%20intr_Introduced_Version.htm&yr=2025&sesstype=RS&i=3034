Red = new code to be enacted WEST VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE2025 REGULAR SESSIONIntroducedHouse Bill 3034By Delegates Fehrenbacher, Crouse, Dittman, Hott, and Young[Introduced; referred to the Committee on]A BILL to amend the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, by adding a new article, designated §18C-10-1, §18C-10-2, §18C-10-3, §18C-10-4, §18C-10-5, and §18C-10-6 relating generally to establishing the West Virginia TEACH Scholarship Program; defining terms; authorizing the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission to award West Virginia TEACH Scholarship Program scholarships under certain terms and conditions; requiring the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission to report certain information on the West Virginia TEACH Scholarship Program; requiring the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission to propose legislative rules; providing eligibility and renewal requirements for a West Virginia TEACH Scholarship Program scholarship; requiring applicants enter into certain agreements; and establishing the West Virginia TEACH Scholarship Program Fund. Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia: Article 10. West virginia TEACH Scholarship Program. §18C-10-1. Short Title. This article shall be known and cited as "The Education and Child-Care Help Scholarship Program," the "West Virginia TEACH Scholarship Program," or "West Virginia TEACH." §18C-10-2. Legislative findings; declaration of public policy. (a) The Legislature finds and declares that:(1) Every West Virginian should have access to education and training that will lead to gainful employment opportunities within the state. For West Virginia to retain and attract a qualified workforce, it must ensure that its workers have access to affordable and quality education and training. (2) West Virginia currently faces a child-care crisis, as the state is struggling to provide access to affordable, high-quality child-care for all families. In turn, this lack of child-care is a barrier to workforce participation.(3) According to the United States Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, West Virginia’s workforce participation rate was 54.9% in 2023, making it the second lowest participation rate in the country. More specific, in 2022, West Virginia had a female workforce participation rate of 49.5% -- the only state below 50%. The lack of affordable, quality child-care contributes to this problem.(4) One of the biggest barriers to child-care is the significant cost to both parents and providers. Many parents struggle to pay the average rate of $800/month – and as a result, many families make the decision to have a parent leave the workforce to stay home. Providers are also experiencing cost-related issues pertaining to staffing. Many providers are losing potential staff members to other industries because of pay. As such, it is very difficult for providers to attract and retain quality employees. (5) Due to the aforementioned challenges, child-care providers are searching for ways to enhance the wages and/or benefits of their employees while also providing better, high-standard services for the children in their care. (6) An investment by the state into increasing access to affordable higher education for child-care workers will provide its citizens the opportunity for self-betterment and will provide the state with an educated and inspired pipeline of early childhood-educated individuals to staff our child-care facilities across the state in an effort to increase our workforce participation needed to attract significant economic development. (b) In enacting this legislation, it is the intention of the Legislature to provide West Virginia with hope and quality child-care by offering opportunities to child-care workers and providers that is needed to remedy the lack of affordable quality child-care and in turn, allow workers to return to the workforce. §18C-10-3. Definitions. (a)  Definitions -- As used in this article, the term:(1) "Commission" means the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission; (2) "Eligible child-care facility" means an early childhood education (ECE) facility maintained by the state or any county or municipality thereof, or any agency or facility maintained by an individual, firm, corporation, association, or organization, public or private, for the care of six or more children for child care services in any setting, if the facility is open for more than 30 days per year per child; (3) "Eligible institution" means:(A) A state community and technical college institution under the authority of the West Virginia Commission for Community and Technical College Education; or(B) A publicly supported four-year college or university in this state; and(4) "Tuition" means the semester or term charges imposed by an eligible institution and, additionally, all mandatory fees required as a condition of enrollment by all students. §18C-10-4.
