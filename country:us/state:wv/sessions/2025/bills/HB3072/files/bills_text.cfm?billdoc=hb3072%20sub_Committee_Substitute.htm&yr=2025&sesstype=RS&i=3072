Cannon, and Canterbury[Originating in the Committee on Energy and Public Works; Reported on March 18, 2025]A BILL to amend the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, by adding thereto a new section, designated §17-4-56, relating to the creation of "Super Two" highways in this state for the construction of certain new roadways.Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia: ARTICLE 4. state road system. §17-4-56. Implementation of "Super Two" highways for certain new roadway construction. (a) Legislative findings. - The Legislature finds that some existing two-lane roads in West Virginia present a danger to drivers when attempting to pass other drivers or when drivers have large trailers or moving vehicles on the roadways. Some states have implemented a "Super Two" design to alleviate this problem. For example, the use of passing lanes on some two-lane highway corridors is known in Texas as the "Super Two" designed roadways. These types of roadways are a common treatment on existing roads to improve overall traffic operations by breaking up traffic platoons and reducing delays caused by inadequate passing opportunities over substantial lengths of roadway. Passing lanes on a two-lane roadway are often much more cost-effective in providing passing opportunities than continuous four-lane sections because locations with high construction costs can be avoided. Additionally, these roadways can be modified to a four-lane highway if needed in the future. A "Super Two" highway is defined as one in which a periodic passing lane is added to a two-lane rural highway to allow passing of slower vehicles and the dispersal of traffic platoons. The passing lane alternates from one direction of travel to the other within a section of roadway, allowing passing opportunities in both directions.(b) Implementation. – For all new roadways constructed in this state that do not require the construction of a four-lane highway, the Division of Highways shall evaluate whether the "Super Two" design as described in subsection (a) of this section is feasible for future development. If the Division of Highways implements a Super Two highway, then the grades of these new roadway projects shall be consistent with existing Appalachian Development Highway standards for lane width, shoulder, grade level crossings, and other standards, and the Division of Highways shall acquire four-line rights-of-way along the Super Two highway, so that Super Two roadways are poised be upgraded to four-lane highways with minimal effort in the future. The West Virginia Division of Highways may coordinate with the Department of Highways of other states for assistance in the design and implementation of these Super Two highways. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to provide for the creation of "Super Two" highways in this state for the construction of certain new roadways.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
