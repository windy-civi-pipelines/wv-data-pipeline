In making a determination on a motion or petition the court shall consider the following factors:(1) The age of the minor child;(2) The relationship between the minor child and the sibling;(3) The relationship between each of the minor child’s parents or the person with whom the minor child is residing and the sibling;(4) The time which has elapsed since the minor child last had contact with the sibling;(5) The effect that visitation will have on the relationship between the minor child and the minor child’s parents or the person with whom the minor child is residing;(6) If the parents are divorced or separated, the custody and visitation arrangement which exists between the parents with regard to the minor child;(7) The time available to the minor child and his or her parents, giving consideration to each parent’s employment schedule, the minor child’s schedule for home, school, and community activities, and the minor child’s and parents’ holiday and vacation schedule;(8) The good faith of the sibling in filing the motion or petition;(9) Any history of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse or neglect being performed, procured, assisted, or condoned by the sibling;(10) Whether the minor child has, in the past, resided with the sibling for a significant time, with or without the minor child's parent or parents;(11) Whether the sibling has, in the past, been a significant caretaker for the minor child, regardless of whether the minor child resided inside or outside of the sibling's residence;(12) The preference of the parents with regard to the requested visitation; and(13) Any other factor relevant to the best interests of the minor child. §48-10A-601. Interview of minor child in chambers. In considering the factors listed in §48-10A-502 of this code for purposes of determining whether to grant visitation, establishing a specific visitation schedule, and resolving any issues related to the making of any determination with respect to visitation or the establishment of any specific visitation schedule, the court may interview in chambers any or all involved minor children regarding their wishes and concerns. No person may be present other than the court, the minor child, the minor child’s attorney or guardian ad litem, if any, and any necessary court personnel. §48-10A-602. Prohibitions on use of minor child's written or recorded statement or affidavit; minor child not to be called as a witness. (a) No person may obtain or attempt to obtain from a minor child a written or recorded statement or affidavit setting forth the wishes and concerns of the minor child regarding sibling visitation matters. The court, in considering the factors listed in §48-10A-502 of this code for purposes of determining whether to grant any visitation, establishing a visitation schedule, or resolving any issues related to the making of any determination with respect to visitation or the establishment of any specific visitation schedule, may not accept or consider such a written or recorded statement or affidavit.(b) A minor child may not be called as a witness in any proceeding to determine whether sibling visitation should be awarded. §48-10A-701. Proof required when action is pending for divorce, custody, legal separation, annulment, or establishment of paternity. If a motion for sibling visitation is filed in a pending action for divorce, custody, legal separation, annulment, or establishment of paternity pursuant to §48-10A-401 of this code, the sibling shall be granted visitation if a preponderance of the evidence shows that visitation is in the best interest of the minor child and that:(1) The party to the divorce through which the sibling is related to the minor child has failed to answer or otherwise appear and defend the cause of action; or(2) The location of the party through which the sibling is related to the minor child is unknown to the party bringing the action and to the sibling who filed the motion for visitation. §48-10A-702. Proof required when action is not pending for divorce, custody, legal separation, annulment, or establishment of paternity. (a) If a petition is filed pursuant to §48-10A-402 of this code when the parent through whom the sibling is related to the minor child does not: (1) have custody of the minor child; (2) share custody of the minor child; or (3) exercise visitation privileges with the minor child that will allow participation in the visitation by the sibling if the parent so choses, the sibling shall be granted visitation if a preponderance of the evidence shows that visitation is in the best interest of the minor child.(b) If a petition is filed pursuant to §48-10A-402 of this code, there is a presumption that visitation privileges need not be extended to the sibling if the parent through whom the sibling is related to the minor child has custody of the minor child, shares custody of the minor child, or exercises visitation privileges with the minor child that will allow participation in the visitation by the sibling if the parent so chooses. This presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that an award of sibling visitation is in the best interest of the minor child. §48-10A-801. Order granting or refusing sibling visitation shall state findings of fact and conclusions of law. An order granting or refusing the sibling's motion or petition for visitation shall state in writing the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law. §48-10A-802. Supervised visitation; conditions on visitation. The court may enter an order granting visitation privileges to a sibling that may require supervised visitation, or the court may place conditions on visitation that it finds are in the best interests of the minor child, including, but not limited to, the following:(1) That the sibling does not attempt to influence any religious beliefs or practices of the minor children in a manner contrary to the preferences of the minor child's parents;(2) That the sibling does not engage in, permit or encourage activities, or expose the minor child to conditions or circumstances, that are contrary to the preferences of the minor child's parents; or(3) That the sibling does not otherwise act in a manner to contradict or interfere with child-rearing decisions made by the minor child's parents. §48-10A-901. Effect of remarriage of the custodial parent. The remarriage of the custodial parent of a minor child does not affect the authority of a circuit court or family court to grant reasonable visitation to any sibling. §48-10A-902. Effect of adoption of the minor child. If a minor child who is subject to a sibling visitation order under this article is later adopted, the order for sibling visitation is automatically vacated when the order for adoption is entered, unless the adopting parent is a stepparent, grandparent, or other relative of the minor child; however, once the order for adoption is entered, the sibling may repetition the court seeking sibling visitation with the minor child. §48-10A-1001. Continuing jurisdiction of circuit court or family court. Any circuit court or family court that grants visitation rights to a sibling retains jurisdiction throughout the minority of the minor child with whom visitation is granted to modify or terminate the rights as dictated by the best interests of the minor child. §48-10A-1002. Termination of sibling visitation. A circuit court or family court shall, based upon a petition brought by an interested person, terminate any grant of the right of sibling visitation upon presentation of a preponderance of the evidence that a sibling granted visitation has materially violated the terms and conditions of the order of visitation. §48-10A-1101. Attorney's fees; reasonable costs. In an action brought under the provisions of this article, a circuit court or family court may order payment of reasonable attorney's fees and costs based upon the equities of the positions asserted by the parties to pay the fees and costs. §48-10A-1201. Misdemeanor offense for allowing contact between minor child and person who has been precluded visitation rights; penalties. Any sibling who knowingly allows contact between a minor child and a parent or other person who has been precluded visitation rights with the minor child by court order is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be confined in jail not more than 30 days or fined not less than $100 nor more than $1,000.

If no order for the allocation of custodial and decision-making responsibility for the child between the parents has been entered by the family court in the pending action for divorce, annulment, or separate maintenance, the family court shall stay any further proceedings concerning the allocation of custodial and decision-making responsibility for the child between the parents and defer to the orders of the circuit court in the abuse or neglect proceedings.(d) If a family court judge is assigned as a judicial officer of a domestic violence court then jurisdiction of all proceedings relating to criminal misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence as referenced in §48-27-301 of this code involving a family or household member as referenced in §48-27-204(1) through §48-27-204(6) and §48-27-204(7)(A), §48-27-204(7)(B), and §48-27-204(7)(H) of this code shall be concurrent with the circuit and magistrate courts.(e) A family court is a court of limited jurisdiction.

A family court may not exercise the powers given courts of record in §51-5-1 of this code or exercise any other powers provided for courts of record in this code unless specifically authorized by the Legislature. A family court judge is not a "judge of any court of record" or a "judge of a court of record" as the terms are defined and used in §51-9-1 et seq. of this code. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to create a statutory right for siblings to petition a circuit or family court for visitation with their minor child siblings.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.

Order granting or refusing sibling visitation shall state findings of fact and conclusions of law. An order granting or refusing the sibling's motion or petition for visitation shall state in writing the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law. §48-10A-802. Supervised visitation; conditions on visitation. The court may enter an order granting visitation privileges to a sibling that may require supervised visitation, or the court may place conditions on visitation that it finds are in the best interests of the minor child, including, but not limited to, the following:(1) That the sibling does not attempt to influence any religious beliefs or practices of the minor children in a manner contrary to the preferences of the minor child's parents;(2) That the sibling does not engage in, permit or encourage activities, or expose the minor child to conditions or circumstances, that are contrary to the preferences of the minor child's parents; or(3) That the sibling does not otherwise act in a manner to contradict or interfere with child-rearing decisions made by the minor child's parents. §48-10A-901. Effect of remarriage of the custodial parent. The remarriage of the custodial parent of a minor child does not affect the authority of a circuit court or family court to grant reasonable visitation to any sibling. §48-10A-902. Effect of adoption of the minor child. If a minor child who is subject to a sibling visitation order under this article is later adopted, the order for sibling visitation is automatically vacated when the order for adoption is entered, unless the adopting parent is a stepparent, grandparent, or other relative of the minor child; however, once the order for adoption is entered, the sibling may repetition the court seeking sibling visitation with the minor child. §48-10A-1001. Continuing jurisdiction of circuit court or family court. Any circuit court or family court that grants visitation rights to a sibling retains jurisdiction throughout the minority of the minor child with whom visitation is granted to modify or terminate the rights as dictated by the best interests of the minor child. §48-10A-1002. Termination of sibling visitation. A circuit court or family court shall, based upon a petition brought by an interested person, terminate any grant of the right of sibling visitation upon presentation of a preponderance of the evidence that a sibling granted visitation has materially violated the terms and conditions of the order of visitation. §48-10A-1101. Attorney's fees; reasonable costs. In an action brought under the provisions of this article, a circuit court or family court may order payment of reasonable attorney's fees and costs based upon the equities of the positions asserted by the parties to pay the fees and costs. §48-10A-1201. Misdemeanor offense for allowing contact between minor child and person who has been precluded visitation rights; penalties. Any sibling who knowingly allows contact between a minor child and a parent or other person who has been precluded visitation rights with the minor child by court order is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be confined in jail not more than 30 days or fined not less than $100 nor more than $1,000.

If no order for the allocation of custodial and decision-making responsibility for the child between the parents has been entered by the family court in the pending action for divorce, annulment, or separate maintenance, the family court shall stay any further proceedings concerning the allocation of custodial and decision-making responsibility for the child between the parents and defer to the orders of the circuit court in the abuse or neglect proceedings.(d) If a family court judge is assigned as a judicial officer of a domestic violence court then jurisdiction of all proceedings relating to criminal misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence as referenced in §48-27-301 of this code involving a family or household member as referenced in §48-27-204(1) through §48-27-204(6) and §48-27-204(7)(A), §48-27-204(7)(B), and §48-27-204(7)(H) of this code shall be concurrent with the circuit and magistrate courts.(e) A family court is a court of limited jurisdiction. A family court is a court of record only for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction in the matters for which the jurisdiction of the family court is specifically authorized in this section and in chapter 48 of this code. A family court may not exercise the powers given courts of record in §51-5-1 of this code or exercise any other powers provided for courts of record in this code unless specifically authorized by the Legislature. A family court judge is not a "judge of any court of record" or a "judge of a court of record" as the terms are defined and used in §51-9-1 et seq. of this code. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to create a statutory right for siblings to petition a circuit or family court for visitation with their minor child siblings.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
