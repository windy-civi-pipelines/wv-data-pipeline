For purposes of this section, "under the direct supervision of a certified professional person" means that certified professional person is present, with and accompanying the aide.(n) Effective July 1, 2025, all state school service personnel shall receive a 25% pay raise across all salary scales. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to provide a 25% pay increase for state school service personnel across all salary scales.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
