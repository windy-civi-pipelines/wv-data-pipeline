Red = new code to be enacted SENATE RESOLUTION 11(By Senators Willis, Thorne, Taylor, Rucker, and Rose)[Introduced February 19, 2025] Recognizing Cottage Hill Farm of Grant County, West Virginia, as West Virginia’s outstanding family-owned Hereford cattle farm for 2024. Whereas, Cottage Hill Farm, in Petersburg, West Virginia, is a 1,000-acre purebred Hereford cow/calf operation that also holds six broiler houses; and  Whereas, W.C. Taylor has implemented numerous conservation practices on the farm over many years, including no-till planting, cover crops, nutrient management, prescribed grazing and rotational grazing of cattle, and wildlife and forest friendly practices; and  Whereas, By rotating cattle through multiple paddocks and allowing areas of the farm to rest more than 21 days, Taylor has extended his grazing season and cut back on the date each year he would need to start feeding hay; and  Whereas, His use of contour strips in hillside crop fields has slowed surface water runoff, which reduces erosion and ultimately improves water quality. He was an early user of phosphorous-based nutrient application rates to protect water quality, and served on a Governor’s Water Quality Committee, due to his early adoption of conservation practices; and   Whereas, Critical area planting around the poultry houses, and soil samples and a nutrient management plan to properly spread nutrients, were implemented which helped protect water quality. A waste storage facility was also constructed, before there was cost-share funding available to build the facilities. Mr. Taylor also practiced energy efficiency methods, using attic insulation, lights, heaters and doors, in the poultry houses; andWhereas, The Taylors are very active in their community, having served on various farm-related boards and committees, in 4-H leadership roles, and they have opened their farm up to research projects and field days in collaboration with WVU Extension; andWhereas, Brad Smith of WVU Extension told judges the Taylors’ and other volunteers’ involvement in a research project helped West Virginia develop the voluntary programs that are helping the state meet its goals to protect the Chesapeake Bay watershed; andWhereas, In 2019, Carole Taylor received a West Virginia Women in Agriculture award. Cottage Hill Farm also received an international Family Farm Environmental Excellence Award in 2007. W.C. Taylor also served for more than 40 years as a district supervisor on the Potomac Valley Conservation District; therefore, be itResolved by the Senate:That the Senate hereby recognizes Cottage Hill Farm of Grant County, West Virginia, as West Virginia’s outstanding family-owned Hereford cattle farm for 2024; and, be it Further Resolved, That the Clerk is hereby directed to forward a copy of this resolution to the family of W.
