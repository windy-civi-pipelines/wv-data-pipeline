The report must state whether an evaluation by a licensed health care professional verified that a concussion or head injury was actually suffered, whether the athlete received written clearance to return to play or practice and, if written clearance was given, the number of days between the incident and the actual return to play or practice. If written clearance to return to play is given after 30 days of the incident, a report update shall be submitted. The West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission shall compile and submit the reports to the appropriate state and national organization or agencies to analyze and make determinations on whether the rule required by this section needs to be amended or if equipment worn by interscholastic athletes needs to be changed accordingly. The West Virginia School Activities Commission also shall submit the reports to the Legislative Oversight Commission on Health and Human Resources Accountability.(8) A requirement that all member schools develop a "Concussion Education, Prevention, and Response Plan" that establishes concussion-related education requirements for appropriate personnel and sets forth practices for preventing concussions and responding to concussions when they do occur.(e) Any member school not complying with the requirements of this section, and rules promulgated thereof, shall be subject to the disciplinary actions ordered by the West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission: Provided, That the West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission shall promulgate rules to establish guidelines for noncompliance and related disciplinary actions: Provided, however, That prior to state board approval and notwithstanding the exemption provided in §29A-1-3 of this code, the state board shall submit the rule to the Legislative Oversight Commission on Education Accountability pursuant to §29A-3B-9 of this code.
