Notwithstanding any other provision of this code pertaining to statute of limitations to the contrary, any statute of limitations set forth in §11-10-1 et seq. of this code for assessment for any such tax, penalty or interest shall not close until five years subsequent to the end of the calendar year during which such manufacturing, fabrication or assembly first occurs.(3)  Minimum employment restriction.(A)  Subject to the limitations and restrictions set forth in this section, "qualified, new or expanded warehouse or distribution facility" does not include a building or facility where the average monthly full-time employment (determined including full-time equivalent employees) for each calendar year at the facility is less than three hundred 50 West Virginia domiciled, West Virginia residents. If during any calendar year within 10 years after the end of the expansion period, the average monthly full-time employment at the building or facility for which qualification for exemption under this section was originally established, is fewer than three hundred 50 qualified West Virginia employees, then the taxpayer will be disqualified from receiving the exemption under this section as of the close of the first calendar year in which the average monthly full-time employment at the facility is less than three hundred 50 West Virginia domiciled, West Virginia residents, and the taxpayer shall be subject to assessment for any tax, penalty or interest that would otherwise have been due had the exemption set forth in this section never been applied. This restriction against having fewer than three hundred 50 qualified West Virginia employees shall not apply to any year subsequent to the 10th year after the end of the expansion period.(B)  Limitations.
