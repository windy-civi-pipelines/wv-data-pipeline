The annual report shall also describe the steps taken by the electric provider to independently verify the reported energy efficiency measures and the estimated savings. The commission may request additional information from the electric provider. If the commission has sufficient reason to believe the information is inaccurate or incomplete, it may request additional information from the customer to ensure the accuracy of the report.(j) If the commission determines that the minimum energy efficiency goals under subdivision (2), subsection (e) of this section have not been achieved at the sites covered by a self-directed plan, in aggregate, the customer will no longer be allowed to participate in the self-direct option and must begin paying the full normal energy efficiency charge. In addition, the commission shall order the customer or customers collectively to pay to the provider, for exclusive use in funding energy efficiency programs, an amount calculated as follows:(1) Determine the proportion of the shortfall in achieving the minimum energy optimization goals under subdivision (2), subsection (e) of this section; then(2) Multiply the figure under subdivision (1) of this subsection by the energy efficiency charges which the customer or customers collectively avoided under subsection (a) of this section; then(3) Multiply the product under subdivision (2) of this subsection by a number not less than one nor greater than two, as determined by the commission based on the reasons for failure to meet the minimum energy efficiency goals. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to provide the Public Service Commission the authority to require electric utilities to develop and implement plans for the efficient use, conservation and reduction of electricity usage. The bill sets forth goals to achieve electricity savings. The bill also requires electric utilities to submit plans for reaching those goals.
