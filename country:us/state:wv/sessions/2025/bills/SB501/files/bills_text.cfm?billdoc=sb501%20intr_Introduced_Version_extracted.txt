(b) A borrower has the right to prepay his or her debt, in whole or in part, at any time and shall receive a rebate for any unearned finance charge, exclusive of any points, investigation fees and loan origination fees, which rebate shall be computed under the actuarial method.(c) Except as provided by §46A-3-109 of this code and by subsection (g) of this section, no additional charges may be made, nor may any charge permitted by this section be assessed unless the loan is made: Provided, That if the loan is not made, the licensee is not required to refund an appraisal fee that is collected from a loan applicant by the licensee and paid to an unrelated third-party appraiser unless the fee is required to be refunded pursuant to federal law.(d) Where loan origination fees, investigation fees or points have been charged by the licensee, the charges may not be imposed again in any refinancing of that loan or any additional loan on that property made within 24 months thereof, unless the new loan has a reasonable, tangible net benefit to the borrower considering all of the circumstances, including the terms of both the new and the refinanced loans, the cost of the new loan and the borrower’s circumstances.  The licensee shall document this benefit in writing on a form prescribed by the commissioner and maintain the documentation in the loan file. To the extent this subdivision overrides the preemption on limiting points and other charges on first lien residential mortgage loans contained in the United States Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, 12 U. S. C. §1735f-7a, the state law limitations contained in this section apply.(e) Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, a delinquent charge or late charge may be charged on any installment made 10 or more days after the regularly scheduled due date in accordance with §46A-3-112 or §46A-3-113 of this code, whichever is applicable.

or (2) The borrower's false or fraudulent representation of a material fact which prevents closing of the loan as proposed.(h) A licensee may not make, offer to make, accept or offer to accept any primary or subordinate mortgage loan except on the terms and conditions authorized in this article.(i) A licensee may not induce or permit any borrower to become obligated to the licensee under this article, directly or contingently, or both, under more than one subordinate mortgage loan at the same time for the purpose or with the result of obtaining greater charges than would otherwise be permitted under the provisions of this article.(j) An instrument evidencing or securing a primary or subordinate mortgage loan may not contain:(1) A power of attorney to confess judgment;(2) A provision whereby the borrower waives any rights accruing to him or her under the provisions of this article;(3) A requirement that more than one installment be payable in any one installment period, or that the amount of any installment be greater or less than that of any other installment, except for the final installment which may be in a lesser amount or no more than $5 greater than any previous payment installment, or unless the loan is structured as a revolving line of credit having no set final payment date: Provided, That this prohibition does not apply to any mortgage modification or refinancing loan made in participation with and in compliance with the federal Making Homes Affordable program, or any other mortgage modification or refinancing loan eligible under any government sponsored enterprise requirements or funded through any federal or state program or litigation settlement;(4) An assignment of or order for the payment of any salary, wages, commissions or other compensation for services, or any part thereof, earned or to be earned;(5) A requirement for compulsory arbitration which does not comply with federal law;

S. C. §1735f-7a, the state law limitations contained in this section apply;(5) Secure a primary or subordinate mortgage loan by any security interest in personal property unless the personal property is affixed to the residential dwelling or real estate;(6) Allow or require a primary or subordinate mortgage loan to be accelerated because of a decrease in the market value of the residential dwelling that is securing the loan;(7) Require terms of repayment which do not result in continuous monthly reduction of the original principal amount of the loan:  Provided, That the provisions of this subdivision do not apply to reverse mortgage loans obtained under §47-24-1 et seq. of this code, home equity, open-end lines of credit, bridge loans used in connection with the purchase or construction of a new residential dwelling or commercial loans for multiple residential purchases;(8) Secure a primary or subordinate mortgage loan in a principal amount that, when added to the aggregate total of the outstanding principal balances of all other primary or subordinate mortgage loans secured by the same property, exceeds the fair market value of the property on the date that the latest mortgage loan is made.  For purposes of this paragraph, a broker or lender may rely upon a bona fide written appraisal of the property made by an independent third-party appraiser, duly licensed or certified by the West Virginia Real Estate Appraiser Licensing and Certification Board and prepared in compliance with the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice:  Provided, That this prohibition does not apply to any mortgage modification or refinancing loan made in participation with and in compliance with the federal Making Homes Affordable program, or any other mortgage modification or refinancing loan eligible under any government sponsored enterprise requirements or funded through any federal or state program or litigation settlement;(9) Advise or recommend that the consumer not make timely payments on an existing loan preceding loan closure of a refinancing transaction; or(10) Knowingly violate any provision of any other applicable state or federal law regulating primary or subordinate mortgage loans, including, without limitation, §46A-1-1 et seq. of this code.   NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to modify the type of writing required to be maintained by a licensee regarding fees or points.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
