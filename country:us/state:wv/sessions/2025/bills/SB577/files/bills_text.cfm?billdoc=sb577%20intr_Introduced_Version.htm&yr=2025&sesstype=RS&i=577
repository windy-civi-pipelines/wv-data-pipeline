This section does not prevent the manufacturer or distributor from requiring that dealers carry a reasonable inventory of models offered for sale by the manufacturer or distributor;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) Order or accept delivery of any new motor vehicle with special features, accessories, or equipment not included in the list price of the new motor vehicle as publicly advertised by the manufacturer or distributor;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(3) Unreasonably participate monetarily in any advertising campaign or contest, or purchase any promotional materials, display devices, display decorations, brand signs and dealer identification, nondiagnostic computer equipment and displays, or other materials at the expense of the dealer;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(4) Enter into any agreement with the manufacturer or distributor or do any other act prejudicial to the dealer by threatening to terminate a dealer agreement, limit inventory, invoke sales and service warranty, or other types of audits or any contractual agreement or understanding existing between the dealer and the manufacturer or distributor, or any manufacturer or distributor&#39;s required or designated vendor or supplier. Notice in good faith to any dealer of the dealer&#39;s violation of any terms or provisions of the dealer agreement is not a violation of this article;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(5) Change the capital structure or financial requirements of the new motor vehicle dealership without reasonable business justification in light of the dealer&#39;s market, historical performance, and compliance with prior capital structure or financial requirements and business necessity, or the means by or through which the dealer finances the operation of the dealership if the dealership at all times meets any reasonable capital standards determined by the manufacturer in accordance with uniformly applied criteria. The burden of proof is on the manufacturer to prove business justification by a preponderance of the evidence;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(6) Refrain from participation in the management of, investment in, or the acquisition of any other line of new motor vehicle or related products: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided</span><span class="csE736517A">, That the dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of vehicle, remains in compliance with reasonable facilities requirements, and makes no change in the principal management of the dealer. Notwithstanding the terms of any dealer agreement, a manufacturer or distributor may not enforce any requirements, including facility or image requirements, that a dealer establish or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or display space, when the requirements are unreasonable considering current economic conditions and are not otherwise justified by reasonable business considerations. The burden of proving that current economic conditions or reasonable business considerations justify such actions is on the manufacturer or distributor and must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(7) Change the location of the new motor vehicle dealership or make any substantial alterations to the dealership premises, where to do so would be unreasonable.

Nothing in this article prevents a dealer, after a civil action is filed, from entering into any agreement of settlement, arbitration, assignment, or waiver of a trial by jury;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(9) Coerce or require any dealer, whether by agreement, program, incentive provision, or otherwise, to construct improvements to its facilities or to install new signs, or other franchisor image elements that replace or substantially alter those improvements, signs, or franchisor image elements completed within the preceding 15 years that were required and approved by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor or distributor branch, or one of its affiliates. If a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch offers incentives or other payments to a retail buyer, lessee, or dealer paid on individual new motor vehicle sales or leases under a program offered after the effective date of this subdivision that are available to more than one dealer in the state that are premised, wholly or in part, on dealer facility improvements or installation of franchiser image elements required by and approved by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, and completed within 15 years preceding the program, &nbsp;the dealer is determined to be in compliance with the program requirements pertaining to construction of facilities or installation of signs or other franchisor image elements that would replace or substantially alter those previously constructed or installed within that 15-year period: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided</span><span class="csE736517A">, That the provisions of this subdivision apply to any dealer who obtains ownership, either through a stock purchase, asset purchase or other means, of a new motor vehicle dealership which has met the requirements of this subdivision within the 15-year period set forth in this subdivision, unless the dealer selling the new motor vehicle dealership has signed an agreement with the manufacturer agreeing to dealer facility improvements or the installation of franchiser image elements prior to an agreement to transfer ownership to a subsequent dealer. This subdivision shall not apply to a program that is in effect with more than one dealer in the state on the effective date of this subsection, nor to any renewal of the program, nor to a modification that is not a modification of a material term or condition of the program;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(10) Condition the award, sale, transfer, relocation, or renewal of a dealer agreement, or to condition sales, service, parts, or finance incentives upon site control or an agreement to renovate or make substantial improvements to a facility: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided</span><span class="csE736517A">, That voluntary and noncoerced acceptance of such conditions by the dealer in writing, including, but not limited to, a written agreement for which the dealer has accepted separate and valuable consideration, does not constitute a violation; </span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(11) Enter into a contractual requirement imposed by the manufacturer, distributor, or a captive finance source as follows:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(A) In this section, &quot;captive finance source&quot; means any financial source that provides automotive-related loans or purchases retail installment contracts or lease contracts for motor vehicles in this state and is, directly or indirectly, owned, operated, or controlled by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor or distributor branch.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(B) It is unlawful for any manufacturer, factory branch, captive finance source, distributor or distributor branch, or any field representative, officer, agent, or any representative of them, notwithstanding the terms, provisions, or conditions of any dealer agreement, to require any of its dealers located in this state to agree to any terms, conditions, or requirements in subdivisions (1) through (10), inclusive, of this subsection in order for the dealer to sell to any captive finance source any retail installment contract, loan, or lease of any new motor vehicles purchased or leased by any of the dealer&#39;s customers, or to be able to participate in, or otherwise, directly or indirectly, obtain the benefits of the retail buyer or lessee transaction incentive program payable to the retail buyer, lessee, or the dealer and offered by or through any captive finance source as to that incentive program.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(C) The applicability of this section is not affected by a choice of law clause in any agreement, waiver, novation, or any other written instrument.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(D) It is unlawful for a manufacturer or distributor to use any subsidiary corporation, affiliated corporation, or any other controlled corporation, partnership, association, or person to accomplish what would otherwise be illegal conduct under this section on the part of the manufacturer or distributor; or</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(12) Agree to any term or provision in the dealer agreement which gives a manufacturer or distributor the right to unilaterally amend the dealer agreement governing the operation and business of a dealer, including, but not limited to, the purchase, sale, lease, or service of new motor vehicles except as provided for in this article. That term or provision is considered null and void. Any amendment to a dealer agreement governing the purchase, sale, lease, or service of new motor vehicles must be agreed upon by both the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch and the dealer at the time the dealer agreement is amended.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(b) A manufacturer or distributor may not do any of the following:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(1) Fail to deliver new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle parts or accessories within a reasonable time and in reasonable quantities relative to the dealer&#39;s market area and facilities, unless the failure is caused by acts or occurrences beyond the control of the manufacturer or distributor, or unless the failure results from an order by the dealer in excess of quantities reasonably and fairly allocated by the manufacturer or distributor. A manufacturer or distributor may not penalize a dealer for an alleged failure to meet sales quotas where the alleged failure is due to actions of the manufacturer or distributor;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(2) Refuse to offer to its same line-make dealers all models manufactured for that line-make, including, but not limited to, any model that contains a separate label or badge indicating an upgraded version of the same model regardless of the new motor vehicle&#39;s means of propulsion: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided</span><span class="csE736517A">, That the dealer meets any reasonable sales, warranty service repair, and recall standards established by the manufacturer or distributor. This prohibition includes a new line make established by a manufacturer with a dealer agreement in this state, or a subsidiary thereof, or a company affiliated through ownership of the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch of at least 25 percent of the equity of the company. This provision does not apply to motorhome, travel trailer, or fold-down camping trailer manufacturers;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(3) Require as a prerequisite to receiving a model or series of new motor vehicles, that a dealer pay an extra unreasonable acquisition fee or surcharge, or purchase unreasonable advertising displays or other materials, or conduct unreasonable facility or image remodeling, renovation, or reconditioning of the dealer&rsquo;s facilities, or any other type of unreasonable upgrade requirement;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(4) Use new motor vehicles in transit but not yet in the dealer&#39;s physical possession in any sales effective or efficiency formula to the detriment of the dealer;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(5) Refuse to disclose to a dealer the method and manner of distribution of new motor vehicles by the manufacturer or distributor, including any numerical calculation or formula used, nationally or within the dealer&#39;s market, to make the allocations within 30 days of a request.

A sales contract signed by a private retail consumer and binding on the dealer which has been submitted to the vehicle manufacturer is evidence of each order. In the event of manufacturer or distributor price reductions or cash rebates, the amount of any reduction or rebate received by a dealer shall be passed on to the private retail buyer or lessee by the dealer. Any price reduction in excess of $5 shall apply to all new motor vehicles in the dealer&rsquo;s inventory which were subject to the price reduction. A price difference applicable to new model or series motor vehicles at the time of the introduction of the new models or the series is not a price increase or price decrease.

A charge back may not be made until the dealer has had notice and an opportunity to support the claim in question within 30 days of receiving notice of the charge back. An otherwise valid reimbursement claim may not be denied once properly submitted in accordance with material and reasonable manufacturer guidelines unless the factory can show that the claim was false or fraudulent, or that the dealer failed to reasonably substantiate the claim consistent with the manufacturer&#39;s written, reasonable, and material guidelines. This subsection does not apply where a claim is fraudulent.
