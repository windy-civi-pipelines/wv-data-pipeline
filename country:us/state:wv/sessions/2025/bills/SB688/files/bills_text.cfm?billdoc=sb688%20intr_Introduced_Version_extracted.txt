Red = new code to be enacted WEST VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE2025 REGULAR SESSIONIntroducedSenate Bill 688By Senators Rose, Thorne, Rucker, and Willis[Introduced March 4, 2025; referredto the Committee on Government Organization; and then to the Committee on the Judiciary]A BILL to amend the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, by adding a new article, designated §15-17-1, §15-17-2, §15-17-3, §15-17-4, §15-17-5, and §15-17-6, relating to prohibiting law-enforcement officers and political subdivision officials from irresponsibly utilizing certain surveillance technologies and artificial intelligence facial recognition technologies; setting forth legislative findings; providing definitions; and establishing parameters for the responsible and constitutional use of these technologies.Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia: Article 17. Responsible Use of facial recognition act. §15-17-1. Short Title. This article shall be known as the "Responsible Use of Facial Recognition Act." §15-17-2. Legislative Findings. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America provides that "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." The Legislature further finds that Article 3-5 of the Constitution of the State of West Virginia provides that "The rights of citizens of this state to be secure in their houses, persons, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. No warrant shall issue except upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing the place to be searched, or the person or thing to be searched." The Legislature finds further that innovations in surveillance and artificial intelligence pose unique threats to the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Legislature additionally finds that these innovations in surveillance and artificial intelligence recognition technology constitute a powerful tool that can be used to combat serious and organized crime, prevent fraud, identify victims, and protect citizens of West Virginia. The Legislature additionally recognizes that appropriate limitations and guardrails are required to ensure that government actors do not misuse facial recognition technology, including in any manner that would pose a threat to the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Therefore, the Legislature finds and declares that law enforcement’s use of facial recognitions technological innovations in surveillance and the use of artificial intelligence int facial recognitions must be closely regulated in accordance with the provisions set forth in this article and subject to publicly available use policies that are developed in accordance with this article.The Legislature further finds and declares that foreign adversarial nations are actively engaged in seeking to harm the national security of the United States of America and the interests of the citizens of West Virginia, and that the foreign technology providers may utilize sub-contractors, employees, and agents from foreign adversarial countries to develop core technology. The Legislature finds that foreign technology providers in surveillance and artificial intelligence have frequently been coopted by foreign adversary governments; that surveillance and artificial intelligence facial recognition technology has the potential to access sensitive government data and investigative records, which, if accessed by foreign adversaries through an intentional security breach, would cause irreparable harm. The Legislature further finds that surveillance and artificial intelligence facial recognition technology may be used to implant back door system access or create security vulnerabilities in critical law enforcement systems. As such, the Legislature finds that foreign adversarial technology providers in facial recognition technology pose an immediate and material threat to the data security of the citizens of West Virginia, as well as to the national security of the United States of America. Therefore, the Legislature finds and declares that law enforcement’s use of surveillance and artificial intelligence facial recognition technology must utilize American-developed technologies that are exclusively developed and manufactured in the United States. §15-17-3. Definitions. As used in this article:(1) "Facial recognition technology" means the use of algorithmic comparison of images of individual's facial features for the purposes of verification or identification, unless used for the sole purpose of authentication in order to access a secure device or secure premises;(2) "Law enforcement agency" means any public agency that employs a law enforcement officer as defined in §30-29-1 and the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles, acting directly or through its duly authorized officers and agents, as defined in West Virginia Code §17A-1-1, et seq.; and (3) "Model facial recognition technology policy" means the model policy developed and published under this article regarding the use of facial recognition technology. §15-17-4.

Investigative records and images used by facial recognition technology may not be provided to private entities but must remain at all times within public systems. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to require law enforcement officers and political subdivision officials from irresponsibly utilizing certain surveillance technologies and artificial intelligence facial recognition technologies, setting forth legislative findings, providing definitions, establishing parameters for the responsible and constitutional use of these technologies.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
