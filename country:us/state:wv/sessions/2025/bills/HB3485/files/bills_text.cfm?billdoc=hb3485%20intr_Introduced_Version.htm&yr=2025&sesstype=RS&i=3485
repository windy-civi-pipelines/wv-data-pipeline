CHAPTER 13A. GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDED INDEBTEDNESS. ARTICLE 1. General Obligation Bonds. §13A-1-1. Legislative findings and intent.

(c) By relocating the provisions of §17‑26‑1 et seq., §17‑26A‑1 et seq., and §31‑15B‑1 of this code to appear within this chapter, it is not the intent of the Legislature to authorize the issuance or sale of new general obligation bonds or to alter or amend the terms, conditions, or legal status of any outstanding general obligation bonds of the state in any manner whatsoever. §13A-1-2.
