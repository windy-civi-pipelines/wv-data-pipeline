RACETRACK VIDEO LOTTERY. §29-22A-10. Accounting and reporting; commission to provide communications protocol data; distribution of net terminal income; remittance through electronic transfer of funds; establishment of accounts and nonpayment penalties; commission control of accounting for net terminal income; settlement of accounts; manual reporting and payment may be required; request for reports; examination of accounts and records. (a) The commission shall provide to manufacturers, or applicants applying for a manufacturer’s permit, the protocol documentation data necessary to enable the respective manufacturer’s video lottery terminals to communicate with the commission’s central computer for transmitting auditing program information and for activation and disabling of video lottery terminals.(b) The gross terminal income of a licensed racetrack shall be remitted to the commission through the electronic transfer of funds. Licensed racetracks shall furnish to the commission all information and bank authorizations required to facilitate the timely transfer of moneys to the commission. Licensed racetracks must provide the commission 30 days’ advance notice of any proposed account changes in order to assure the uninterrupted electronic transfer of funds. From the gross terminal income remitted by the licensee to the commission:(1) The commission shall deduct an amount sufficient to reimburse the commission for its actual costs and expenses incurred in administering racetrack video lottery at the licensed racetrack and the resulting amount after the deduction is the net terminal income. The amount deducted for administrative costs and expenses of the commission may not exceed four percent of gross terminal income: Provided, That any amounts deducted by the commission for its actual costs and expenses that exceeds its actual costs and expenses shall be deposited into the State Lottery Fund. For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2011 through June 30, 2030, the term "actual costs and expenses" may include transfers of up to $9 million in surplus allocations for each fiscal year, as calculated by the commission when it has closed its books for the fiscal year, to the Licensed Racetrack Modernization Fund created by subdivision (2), of this subsection. For all fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2001, the commission shall not receive an amount of gross terminal income in excess of the amount of gross terminal income received during the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2001, but four percent of any amount of gross terminal income received in excess of the amount of gross terminal income received during the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2001, shall be deposited into the fund established in §29-22-18a of this code; and(2) A Licensed Racetrack Modernization Fund is created within the lottery fund. For all fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2011, and ending with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2030, the commission shall deposit such amounts as are available according to subdivision (1) of this subsection into a separate facility modernization account maintained within the Licensed Racetrack Modernization Fund for each racetrack. Each racetrack’s share of each year’s deposit shall be calculated in the same ratio as each racetrack’s apportioned contribution to the four percent administrative costs and expenses allowance provided for in subdivision (1) of this subsection for that year. For each $2 expended by a licensed racetrack for facility modernization improvements or capital improvements at facilities located in this state that are on or contiguous to the premises of the licensed racetrack, having a useful life of three or more years and placed in service after July 1, 2011, the licensed racetrack shall receive $1 in recoupment from its facility modernization account. If the licensed racetrack’s facility modernization account contains a balance in any fiscal year, the unexpended balance from that fiscal year will be available for matching for one additional fiscal year, after which time, the remaining unused balance carried forward shall revert to the lottery fund. For purposes of this section, the term "facility modernization improvements" includes acquisitions of new and unused video lottery terminals and related equipment, and the term "capital improvements" means real property that is expected to replace or modernize buildings, equipment, machinery and other tangible property used in connection with the operation of the gaming, hospitality, or entertainment at the facility. Video lottery terminals financed through the recoupment provided in this subdivision must be retained by the licensee in its West Virginia licensed location for a period of not less than five years from the date of initial installation.(c) The amount resulting after the deductions required by subsection (b) of this section constitutes net terminal income that shall be divided as set out in this subsection. For all fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2001, any amount of net terminal income received in excess of the amount of net terminal income received during the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2001, shall be divided as set out in §29-22A-10b of this code.
