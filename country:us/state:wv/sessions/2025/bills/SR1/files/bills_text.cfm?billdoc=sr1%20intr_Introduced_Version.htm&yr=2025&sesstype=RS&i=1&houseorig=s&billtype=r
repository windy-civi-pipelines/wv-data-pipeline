On a call of the Senate, the doors shall not be closed against any member until his or her name shall have been twice called.2. In case a less number than a quorum of the Senate shall convene, the members present are hereby authorized to send the Sergeant at Arms, or any other person or persons by them authorized, for any and all absent members as the majority of such members shall agree, at the expense of such absent members, respectively, unless such excuse for nonattendance shall be made as the Senate, when a quorum is convened, shall judge sufficient; and, in that case, the expense shall be paid out of the contingent fund of the Senate. This rule shall apply, as well to the first meeting of the Senate at the legal time of meeting, as to each day of the session, after the hour has arrived to which the Senate stood adjourned.OFFICERS3. The Senate, at the commencement of each new Legislature, shall elect as its officers a President, Clerk, Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper. If at any time the President is obligated to act as Governor pursuant to Article VII, Section 16 of the Constitution of West Virginia, the Senate shall immediately elect one of its remaining members to serve as Acting President. The Acting President shall act and serve at all times when the duly elected President is acting as Governor and shall perform all of the duties of the office of Senate President without limitation, including any duties imposed by the Constitution of West Virginia, any statute, the Senate Rules and any adopted Joint Rules of the Senate and House of Delegates, and he or she shall receive the compensation and expenses of the President of the Senate as provided in article two-a, chapter four of the Code of West Virginia. The Acting President shall not be in the line of succession to act as Governor under the provisions of Article VII, Section 16 of the Constitution of West Virginia. The majority vote of all the members elected to the Senate shall be necessary for the election of these officers and the vote shall be by voice vote and be recorded in the Journal. 4. The President of the Senate or Acting President shall appoint a President pro Tempore, who, during the absence of the President or Acting President, if any, shall preside and perform all the duties of the President. 5. The presiding officer may call a member to the chair who shall perform the duties of the chair until the presiding officer returns to the chair, but no member by virtue of such appointment shall preside for a longer period than three consecutive legislative days. 6. The Clerk of the Senate shall not allow any records or papers to be taken from the table or out of his or her custody except by a chair of a committee to which they may have been referred and then only upon a proper receipt therefor and except as required by these rules or by the Joint Rules of the Senate and House of Delegates.ORDER OF BUSINESS AND PROCEDURE7.

The presiding officer may recognize the member by name; but no member in debate or remarks shall designate another by name.9. Any member may call for a division of any question before the vote thereon is taken, if it comprehend propositions so distinct in substance that, one being taken away, a substantive proposition will remain for the decision of the Senate, but the member calling for the division of a question shall state in what manner it shall be divided. A motion to strike out and insert is not divisible.10. The rejection of a motion to strike out and insert one proposition shall not prevent a motion to strike out and insert a different proposition and shall not prevent a subsequent motion to simply strike out. The rejection of a motion simply to strike out shall not prevent a subsequent motion to strike out and insert.11. No question shall be debated until it has been propounded by the presiding officer. The presiding officer, after calling a member to assume the chair, the mover of the question, the chair of the committee that reported the matter or the sponsor of the bill or resolution, in that order of preference, shall have the right to explain his or her views in preference to any other member. 12. No member shall speak more than twice upon the same question without leave of the Senate or more than once until every member choosing to speak shall have spoken, except that the mover of the question shall have the right to close the debate thereon. 13.

No Senate bill, other than a Senate supplementary appropriation bill, and no Senate joint resolution shall be introduced in the Senate after the forty-first day of a regular session unless permission to introduce the bill or the joint resolution be given by a Senate resolution, setting out the title to the bill or the joint resolution and adopted by two-thirds vote of the members present. When permission is requested to introduce a bill or joint resolution under the provisions of this rule, duplicate copies of the bill or the joint resolution shall accompany the resolution when introduced and all such bills or joint resolutions shall be filed electronically with the Clerk’s office.Standing and select committees of the Senate may originate a bill or joint resolution and report the same after the forty-first day.

No concurrent resolution requesting the naming of transportation infrastructure may be adopted by the Senate after the fifty-fifth day.The forty-first day of the regular session held in the year one thousand nine hundred seventy-seven and every fourth year thereafter shall be computed from and include the second Wednesday of February of such years.15. Each bill or resolution for introduction shall be presented in duplicate and electronically, bearing the name of the member or members by whom it is to be introduced, and shall be filed with the Clerk not later than twelve o'clock noon on the legislative day next preceding its introduction: Provided, That the pre-filing requirement shall not apply to the first day of any session of the Legislature. A bill may be introduced by request. All bills introduced by request shall bear the words “By Request”, following the designation of the name or names of the bill sponsor or sponsors. The Clerk shall designate one copy of a bill or resolution the official copy and it shall constitute the official bill or resolution for use of committees and for the permanent files of the Senate. One copy shall be used for printing. Each bill or resolution shall be numbered, edited and corrected as to form by the Clerk and reported by the Clerk to the Senate on the next legislative day, under the sixth order of business. In case of urgency, on motion for leave agreed to by a majority of the members present, a member may introduce a bill or resolution from the floor. Any member who is a co-sponsor sponsor, other than the original lead sponsor, of a bill or resolution may be removed as a sponsor of the bill or resolution by submitting a request to the Clerk prior to the bill being enrolled or the resolution being adopted. Any member may be added as a co-sponsor of a bill or resolution by submitting a request to the Clerk prior to the bill or resolution being reported from the last committee to which it was referred.The electronic version of a bill or resolution shall be changed to include the addition or removal of a sponsor, but the addition or removal of a sponsor shall only be included in a printed version if a subsequent printing is otherwise required.15a. Prior to any committee reporting a bill to the floor, any bill which either increases or decreases the revenue or fiscal liability of the State or any county, municipality or other subdivision of the State or in any manner changes or modifies any existing tax or rate of taxation, such bill shall have attached thereto a fiscal note, if available. It shall be the responsibility of the legislator introducing a bill to obtain such note when required, which shall conform to the requirements as to form and content as prescribed by the Clerk. The jackets of all measures with fiscal notes attached or requiring such notes shall have the words "Fiscal Note" or the initials "FN" clearly stamped or endorsed thereon. 15b. Upon the introduction of any legislation which has a potential impact on the state’s economy, the presiding officer may request from any institution under the authority of the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission, including, but not limited to, West Virginia University and Marshall University, a review of the proposed legislation for purposes of preparing a “Jobs and Wages Impact Statement”. Any such statement shall be based on generally accepted methodology and shall conform to the requirements as to form and content as prescribed by the Clerk: Provided, That the Clerk shall prescribe that all Jobs and Wages Impact Statements shall include an analysis of both the jobs that are projected to be gained or lost if the legislation is adopted and any wage impact associated with the projected job changes, including wage increases or decreases in existing jobs, wages of jobs lost, wages of new jobs and the net impact on wages. The phrase “Jobs and Wages Impact Statement” or the initials “JWS” must be clearly stamped or endorsed on the jackets of all bills that have statements attached to them. No act is void or voidable if it does not contain a “Jobs and Wages Impact Statement” even when requested.16. All concurrent and simple resolutions when introduced shall lie on the table at least one day, and then be referred to the appropriate committee unless the Senate directs otherwise by majority vote of the members present. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Senate that concurrent resolutions be limited to the general purposes of expressing the sentiments of the Legislature, for authorizing expenditures incidental to the sessions and business of the Legislature, for agreeing upon adjournments beyond the constitutional limitation, for creating special joint committees, for raising a joint assembly and other inferior and incidental purposes of legislation, and such other purposes as the Legislature may deem proper. The adoption of such resolutions must be concurred in by both houses. Concurrent resolutions shall be restricted to expressions of sentiments and actions having a bearing upon matters incident to legislative business and the functioning of the legislative process insofar as possible. Concurrent resolutions shall not embrace congratulatory expressions to individuals, organizations, associations or other entities having no relation to the Legislature or public affairs generally, athletic events, scholastic contests, or any other matter not related to the scope and areas of legislative business: Provided, That this rule shall not bar the introduction of resolutions memorializing deceased members of the Legislature and public officials or commending or congratulating public officials on actions in connection with governmental affairs. 17. Unless otherwise directed by the Committee on Rules all bills, resolutions or business originating in the Senate shall be considered at the appropriate order of business in the order in which they are introduced, and all bills and resolutions received from the House of Delegates shall be introduced in the order in which they are received and shall be considered at the appropriate order of business in their numerical order.18. All bills and joint resolutions introduced shall be read by their titles and referred to the appropriate committee and shall be treated in committee as resolutions of inquiry. If the committee reports a bill or resolution different, either by amendment or substitution, from the one introduced, it shall be received and treated by the Senate as the original bill or resolution. All Senate bills and joint resolutions reported by a committee shall be made available, with the proposed committee amendments on the foot thereof, and shall be then read a first time, unless in any of the aforesaid cases the Senate directs otherwise by majority vote of the members present. All bills and resolutions passed or adopted by and reported from the House of Delegates shall be read by their titles and referred to the appropriate committee unless the Senate directs otherwise by majority vote of the members present. 18a. Any bill, resolution or business which does not follow the procedures of Rule Nos. 17 and 18 shall remain in the possession of the Committee on Rules. 19. All bills shall be read on three different days, unless in case of urgency, by four-fifths vote of the members present, taken by yeas and nays, on each bill, this rule be dispensed with. Joint resolutions proposing amendments to the Constitution of West Virginia shall be read on three different days which readings shall not be suspended.20. All engrossed bills shall be fully and distinctly read when put upon their passage. 21. On each reading of the bill the Clerk shall state whether it is the first, second or third reading of such bill, but no bill shall be put upon its second reading until the same shall have been made available to the members of the Senate at least one day previous to such reading, unless the Senate directs otherwise by majority vote of the members present. 21a. Upon motion of any member, on any legislative day or the day preceding, the Senate may, by two-thirds vote of those present, establish a period of time known as "Bill Reading Docket". Such motion shall state each bill to be read, the time and order for such bill reading docket to commence and to conclude, and may provide for the adjournment or recess of the Senate for not more than one legislative day, during which reading of the docket no motion, except a motion to postpone the reading of the bills, by two-thirds vote of those elected, shall be heard. A quorum shall not be required during the reading of the docket. Any and all members requesting that a bill be read shall be present at all times in the Chamber during its reading. All bills read on the bill reading docket shall be considered as having been read fully and distinctly. 22. On the first reading of a bill, a motion to reject the bill shall be in order. 23. If a committee shall have reported adversely to a bill or resolution, the presiding officer immediately after the report of said committee is read shall put the question, "Shall the bill be rejected?" or “Shall the resolution be rejected?” which question shall have precedence over all motions, except a motion to adjourn.24. A bill or joint resolution shall be amended only on second reading: Provided, That after the passage of a bill or adoption of a joint resolution, amendments to its title may be offered. When a bill or joint resolution is being read for amendment, it shall be read section by section on the demand of any two members. When the amendments which may be moved shall be disposed of, the question shall be taken on ordering a Senate bill or joint resolution to be engrossed and ordered to third reading and on ordering a House bill or joint resolution to third reading. If a Senate bill or joint resolution should be ordered to its engrossment and third reading, and amendments thereto have been made, the bill or joint resolution shall be changed to conform to the amendments and become the engrossed bill or joint resolution. If no amendments are made, the original bill or joint resolution may be ordered to its third reading and shall become the engrossed bill or joint resolution. All Senate bills or joint resolutions so ordered shall be jacketed, endorsed with their number, title, by whom introduced, and if the bill or joint resolution is finally passed or adopted, the date of its passage or adoption and the signature of the Clerk. If a Senate bill or joint resolution should be passed or adopted by the House and returned to the Senate without amendments, or if amended, and the amendments should be agreed to, the bill or joint resolution shall be enrolled by the Clerk. Enrolled Senate bills shall be delivered to the Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills. In the case of a House bill or joint resolution on second reading if the same be amended, the amendment or amendments shall be noted in full and attached to the bill or joint resolution at the proper place by the Clerk before the bill or joint resolution is returned to the House, and all amendments shall appear in the Senate Journal.25. When a bill or joint resolution is put upon its passage or adoption, respectively, the presiding officer shall propound the question, "Shall the bill pass?" or "Shall the resolution be adopted?" On the passage or adoption, respectively, of every bill or joint resolution, the vote shall be taken by yeas and nays.26. When a Senate bill or Senate joint resolution passed by the Senate shall be amended by the House of Delegates, the question on agreeing to the bill or joint resolution, as amended, shall be again voted on by yeas and nays in the Senate. In all such cases the affirmative majority vote of all the members elected to the Senate shall be necessary.COMMITTEES27.

If any witness to whom an oath has been administered shall refuse to answer a question put to such witness by any member of the committee, the committee may report such refusal to the Senate, and the Senate may cause to be issued a subpoena to compel such witness to appear before the committee to give testimony. Upon appearance pursuant to subpoena, the witness may be questioned by the chairman and members of the committee.

If a member be called to order for words spoken in debate, the person calling the member to order shall repeat the words excepted to, and they shall be taken down in writing at the Clerk's table; and no member shall be held to answer, or be subject to the censure of the Senate, for words spoken in debate if any other member has spoken or other business has intervened after the words spoken and before the exception to them was taken.36. While the presiding officer is reporting or putting a question, no one shall entertain private discourse or walk into, out of or across the Chamber. When a member is addressing the presiding officer, no one shall entertain private discourse or pass between the member and the presiding officer. 37.

When a question is pending, no motion shall be received except: 	1.	To adjourn. 	2.	To lay on the table. 	3.	For the previous question. 	4.	To postpone the question to a different day. 	5.	To commit. 	6.	To amend. 	7.	To postpone indefinitely. These several motions shall have precedence in order in which they are arranged. 40. The following motions shall be decided without debate, and shall not be amended: 	1.	To adjourn. 	2.	To fix the time to which the Senate shall adjourn. 	3.	To lay on the table. 	4.	For the previous question. 	5.	To suspend the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three 				different days. 	6.	To recess.41. There shall be a motion for the previous question, which being ordered by a majority of the members present, shall have the effect to cut off all debate and bring the Senate to a direct vote upon the immediate question or questions on which it has been asked and ordered. The previous question may be asked and ordered upon a single motion, a series of motions, or may be made to embrace all authorized motions or amendments and include the bill to its engrossment and third reading and then, on renewal and second of said motion, to its passage or rejection. It shall be in order, pending a motion for, or after the previous question shall have been ordered on its passage, for the presiding officer to entertain and submit a motion to commit with or without instructions to a standing or select committee. A motion to lay upon the table pending a motion for the previous question shall be in order only when the previous question has been moved on the second or third reading of a bill. A call of the Senate shall not be in order after the previous question is ordered, unless it shall appear upon an actual count by the presiding officer that a quorum is not present. All incidental questions of order arising after a motion is made for the previous question, and pending such motion, shall be decided, whether on appeal or otherwise, without debate. RECONSIDERATION OF VOTE42. After any question has been decided in the affirmative or in the negative, it shall be in order for any member who voted with the prevailing side to move for a reconsideration of the vote thereon at any time on the same day or the next succeeding day of actual session. Any member may make the motion to reconsider, when the yeas and nays have not been taken. If the Senate refuse to reconsider, or upon reconsideration shall affirm its first decision, no further motion to reconsider shall be in order. No vote shall be reconsidered upon motions to adjourn, to lay on the table, to take from the table or for the previous question. The motion to reconsider may be put and acted upon when made. If seconded, it shall take precedence of all other questions, except the consideration of a conference report and the motion to adjourn, and unless by motion postponed until some future date be acted upon at once. When a motion to reconsider is made and not acted upon at the time, it shall be placed upon the calendar, under unfinished business, and be acted upon the next succeeding day of actual session. A motion to reconsider shall not be withdrawn without leave of the Senate. No bill, resolution, message, report, amendment or motion, upon which a motion is pending to reconsider the vote thereon, shall be taken out of the possession of the Senate until final disposition of the motion to reconsider. No motion for reconsideration of the vote on any question, which has gone out of the possession of the Senate, shall be in order unless subsequently recalled by vote of the Senate and in possession of the Clerk. When a motion to reconsider has been adopted, its effect shall be to place before the Senate the original question in the exact position it occupied before it was voted upon. VOTING43. Every member within the Chamber, when a question is put, shall vote unless he or she is immediately and particularly interested therein, meaning an interest that affects the member directly and not as one of a class, or the Senate excuses him or her. A member may raise an inquiry to the presiding officer regarding whether he or she should not vote or should be excused from voting on a particular matter, but the member may still be required to vote. All motions to excuse a member from voting must be made by the member requesting to be excused before the Senate divides, or before the call of the yeas and nays is commenced, and it shall be decided without debate, except that the member making the motion to be excused from voting may briefly state the reason why it ought to be adopted. No members may pair on any question.44. The yeas and nays shall be taken on motions to dispense with the constitutional rule requiring a bill to be fully and distinctly read on three different days; on setting the effective date of an act of the Legislature; on agreeing to a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution of West Virginia; on the passage of a bill notwithstanding the objections of the Governor; on the passage of a supplementary appropriation bill; on the passage of a Senate bill or Senate joint resolution amended by the House; on all questions where a specific vote is required by the Constitution of West Virginia, the Joint Rules of the Senate and House of Delegates, or by these rules; on the passage of a bill; and on quorum calls: Provided, That the yeas and nays shall be taken on demand of any member on any question unless another member objects. Upon any such objection the presiding officer shall inquire of the membership if the demand for the yeas and nays is sustained. If the demand is so sustained by one tenth of the members present, the yeas and nays shall be taken, and, if the demand is not sustained by one tenth of the members present, then the yeas and nays shall not be taken. The result of all votes taken by yeas and nays shall be recorded in the Journal. When the yeas and nays are recorded in the Journal, the result of the vote as to total yeas, nays and absentees shall be recorded, with the names of the Senators voting yea or nay, and those absent. When the yeas and nays are ordered, or a call of the Senate is directed, the names of the members shall be called in alphabetical order; excepting, however, the name of the presiding officer, which shall be called last. After completion of a roll call vote, no member shall speak to explain his or her vote. A member's vote explanation shall not be recorded in the daily Journal. A member may have his or her vote explanation recorded in the bound Journal provided the member obtains the floor and makes this request immediately following announcement of the results of the roll call vote and disposition of the matter and delivers his or her written vote explanation to the Clerk within three legislative days during the session or, if there are less than three legislative days remaining in the session, within seventy-two hours after adjournment sine die. The Clerk shall note on the daily Journal for the day of the roll call vote that the member has reserved the privilege of having his or her vote explanation recorded later in the bound Journal. 45. On all roll calls of the yeas and nays when the voting machine is not used, and before the result is announced, the Clerk shall at the request of any member read either the names of those who voted yea or of those who voted nay, whichever is the smaller number, and the names of those absent and not voting, if any, and shall announce that all others voted either yea or nay, whichever is the larger number. In the event of a tie vote, the Clerk shall upon such request read the names of those who voted yea and the names of those absent and not voting, if any, and shall announce that all others voted nay. At that time any member shall have the right to correct any mistake committed in enrolling his or her name. The vote then shall be announced and the count recorded in the Journal. 45a. The voting machine may be used in taking the yeas and nays on any question, including quorum calls. When the machine is used for quorum calls, a member shall indicate "present" by use of the green "yea" button. When using the voting machine, the presiding officer shall announce the question to be voted upon and direct the Clerk to prepare the machine. The presiding officer shall then state, "The members will now vote." After reasonable time has been given for all members to vote, the presiding officer shall ask, "Have all members voted?" The presiding officer shall then direct the Clerk to close the machine and ascertain the result. The presiding officer shall promptly announce the result. Voting shall be continuous and shall be permitted until the result thereof is announced by the presiding officer: Provided, That any vote cast after the machine has been closed shall be stated by the presiding officer as having been cast and such shall be recorded in the Journal: Provided, however, That no vote may be cast after the vote has been announced. While the members are voting and before the machine is closed, the wall display boards shall continuously display the vote of each member and the total pending vote. Under no circumstance shall a member or nonmember vote on behalf of another member. All other rules governing voting and the taking of the yeas and nays, insofar as applicable, shall apply to taking votes by means of the voting machine. MESSAGES46. The Clerk of the Senate may interchange messages with the Clerk of the House of Delegates at any time. 47. Messages may be received in any stage of business except when the presiding officer is reporting or putting a question or while the yeas and nays are being taken. Messages and reports received by the Clerk, which do not require action by the Senate, shall be considered received by the Senate and filed with the Clerk and shall be recorded in the Journal.48. When a bill or resolution of the House of Delegates is passed or rejected by the Senate, the fact of its passage or rejection, with the bill or resolution shall be communicated to the House of Delegates. JOURNAL49. The Journal of the Senate shall be daily prepared by the Clerk and shall be read, corrected and approved the succeeding day. It shall be published under the supervision of the Clerk and made available to the members without delay. After the Journal has been approved and fully marked for corrections, regular bound volumes of the Journal from the type so corrected shall be printed.

This rule shall apply, as well to the first meeting of the Senate at the legal time of meeting, as to each day of the session, after the hour has arrived to which the Senate stood adjourned.OFFICERS3. The Senate, at the commencement of each new Legislature, shall elect as its officers a President, Clerk, Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper. If at any time the President is obligated to act as Governor pursuant to Article VII, Section 16 of the Constitution of West Virginia, the Senate shall immediately elect one of its remaining members to serve as Acting President. The Acting President shall act and serve at all times when the duly elected President is acting as Governor and shall perform all of the duties of the office of Senate President without limitation, including any duties imposed by the Constitution of West Virginia, any statute, the Senate Rules and any adopted Joint Rules of the Senate and House of Delegates, and he or she shall receive the compensation and expenses of the President of the Senate as provided in article two-a, chapter four of the Code of West Virginia.

In case of urgency, on motion for leave agreed to by a majority of the members present, a member may introduce a bill or resolution from the floor. Any member who is a co-sponsor sponsor, other than the original lead sponsor, of a bill or resolution may be removed as a sponsor of the bill or resolution by submitting a request to the Clerk prior to the bill being enrolled or the resolution being adopted. Any member may be added as a co-sponsor of a bill or resolution by submitting a request to the Clerk prior to the bill or resolution being reported from the last committee to which it was referred.The electronic version of a bill or resolution shall be changed to include the addition or removal of a sponsor, but the addition or removal of a sponsor shall only be included in a printed version if a subsequent printing is otherwise required.15a.

The jackets of all measures with fiscal notes attached or requiring such notes shall have the words "Fiscal Note" or the initials "FN" clearly stamped or endorsed thereon. 15b. Upon the introduction of any legislation which has a potential impact on the state’s economy, the presiding officer may request from any institution under the authority of the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission, including, but not limited to, West Virginia University and Marshall University, a review of the proposed legislation for purposes of preparing a “Jobs and Wages Impact Statement”. Any such statement shall be based on generally accepted methodology and shall conform to the requirements as to form and content as prescribed by the Clerk: Provided, That the Clerk shall prescribe that all Jobs and Wages Impact Statements shall include an analysis of both the jobs that are projected to be gained or lost if the legislation is adopted and any wage impact associated with the projected job changes, including wage increases or decreases in existing jobs, wages of jobs lost, wages of new jobs and the net impact on wages.

All concurrent and simple resolutions when introduced shall lie on the table at least one day, and then be referred to the appropriate committee unless the Senate directs otherwise by majority vote of the members present. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Senate that concurrent resolutions be limited to the general purposes of expressing the sentiments of the Legislature, for authorizing expenditures incidental to the sessions and business of the Legislature, for agreeing upon adjournments beyond the constitutional limitation, for creating special joint committees, for raising a joint assembly and other inferior and incidental purposes of legislation, and such other purposes as the Legislature may deem proper. The adoption of such resolutions must be concurred in by both houses. Concurrent resolutions shall be restricted to expressions of sentiments and actions having a bearing upon matters incident to legislative business and the functioning of the legislative process insofar as possible. Concurrent resolutions shall not embrace congratulatory expressions to individuals, organizations, associations or other entities having no relation to the Legislature or public affairs generally, athletic events, scholastic contests, or any other matter not related to the scope and areas of legislative business: Provided, That this rule shall not bar the introduction of resolutions memorializing deceased members of the Legislature and public officials or commending or congratulating public officials on actions in connection with governmental affairs. 17. Unless otherwise directed by the Committee on Rules all bills, resolutions or business originating in the Senate shall be considered at the appropriate order of business in the order in which they are introduced, and all bills and resolutions received from the House of Delegates shall be introduced in the order in which they are received and shall be considered at the appropriate order of business in their numerical order.18. All bills and joint resolutions introduced shall be read by their titles and referred to the appropriate committee and shall be treated in committee as resolutions of inquiry. If the committee reports a bill or resolution different, either by amendment or substitution, from the one introduced, it shall be received and treated by the Senate as the original bill or resolution. All Senate bills and joint resolutions reported by a committee shall be made available, with the proposed committee amendments on the foot thereof, and shall be then read a first time, unless in any of the aforesaid cases the Senate directs otherwise by majority vote of the members present. All bills and resolutions passed or adopted by and reported from the House of Delegates shall be read by their titles and referred to the appropriate committee unless the Senate directs otherwise by majority vote of the members present. 18a. Any bill, resolution or business which does not follow the procedures of Rule Nos. 17 and 18 shall remain in the possession of the Committee on Rules. 19.

Joint resolutions proposing amendments to the Constitution of West Virginia shall be read on three different days which readings shall not be suspended.20. All engrossed bills shall be fully and distinctly read when put upon their passage. 21. On each reading of the bill the Clerk shall state whether it is the first, second or third reading of such bill, but no bill shall be put upon its second reading until the same shall have been made available to the members of the Senate at least one day previous to such reading, unless the Senate directs otherwise by majority vote of the members present. 21a. Upon motion of any member, on any legislative day or the day preceding, the Senate may, by two-thirds vote of those present, establish a period of time known as "Bill Reading Docket". Such motion shall state each bill to be read, the time and order for such bill reading docket to commence and to conclude, and may provide for the adjournment or recess of the Senate for not more than one legislative day, during which reading of the docket no motion, except a motion to postpone the reading of the bills, by two-thirds vote of those elected, shall be heard. A quorum shall not be required during the reading of the docket. Any and all members requesting that a bill be read shall be present at all times in the Chamber during its reading. All bills read on the bill reading docket shall be considered as having been read fully and distinctly. 22. On the first reading of a bill, a motion to reject the bill shall be in order. 23. If a committee shall have reported adversely to a bill or resolution, the presiding officer immediately after the report of said committee is read shall put the question, "Shall the bill be rejected?" or “Shall the resolution be rejected?” which question shall have precedence over all motions, except a motion to adjourn.24. A bill or joint resolution shall be amended only on second reading: Provided, That after the passage of a bill or adoption of a joint resolution, amendments to its title may be offered. When a bill or joint resolution is being read for amendment, it shall be read section by section on the demand of any two members. When the amendments which may be moved shall be disposed of, the question shall be taken on ordering a Senate bill or joint resolution to be engrossed and ordered to third reading and on ordering a House bill or joint resolution to third reading. If a Senate bill or joint resolution should be ordered to its engrossment and third reading, and amendments thereto have been made, the bill or joint resolution shall be changed to conform to the amendments and become the engrossed bill or joint resolution. If no amendments are made, the original bill or joint resolution may be ordered to its third reading and shall become the engrossed bill or joint resolution. All Senate bills or joint resolutions so ordered shall be jacketed, endorsed with their number, title, by whom introduced, and if the bill or joint resolution is finally passed or adopted, the date of its passage or adoption and the signature of the Clerk. If a Senate bill or joint resolution should be passed or adopted by the House and returned to the Senate without amendments, or if amended, and the amendments should be agreed to, the bill or joint resolution shall be enrolled by the Clerk. Enrolled Senate bills shall be delivered to the Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills. In the case of a House bill or joint resolution on second reading if the same be amended, the amendment or amendments shall be noted in full and attached to the bill or joint resolution at the proper place by the Clerk before the bill or joint resolution is returned to the House, and all amendments shall appear in the Senate Journal.25. When a bill or joint resolution is put upon its passage or adoption, respectively, the presiding officer shall propound the question, "Shall the bill pass?" or "Shall the resolution be adopted?" On the passage or adoption, respectively, of every bill or joint resolution, the vote shall be taken by yeas and nays.26. When a Senate bill or Senate joint resolution passed by the Senate shall be amended by the House of Delegates, the question on agreeing to the bill or joint resolution, as amended, shall be again voted on by yeas and nays in the Senate.

To commit. 	6.	To amend. 	7.	To postpone indefinitely. These several motions shall have precedence in order in which they are arranged. 40.

For the previous question. 	5.	To suspend the constitutional rule requiring bills to be read on three 				different days. 	6.	To recess.41. There shall be a motion for the previous question, which being ordered by a majority of the members present, shall have the effect to cut off all debate and bring the Senate to a direct vote upon the immediate question or questions on which it has been asked and ordered. The previous question may be asked and ordered upon a single motion, a series of motions, or may be made to embrace all authorized motions or amendments and include the bill to its engrossment and third reading and then, on renewal and second of said motion, to its passage or rejection. It shall be in order, pending a motion for, or after the previous question shall have been ordered on its passage, for the presiding officer to entertain and submit a motion to commit with or without instructions to a standing or select committee. A motion to lay upon the table pending a motion for the previous question shall be in order only when the previous question has been moved on the second or third reading of a bill. A call of the Senate shall not be in order after the previous question is ordered, unless it shall appear upon an actual count by the presiding officer that a quorum is not present. All incidental questions of order arising after a motion is made for the previous question, and pending such motion, shall be decided, whether on appeal or otherwise, without debate. RECONSIDERATION OF VOTE42. After any question has been decided in the affirmative or in the negative, it shall be in order for any member who voted with the prevailing side to move for a reconsideration of the vote thereon at any time on the same day or the next succeeding day of actual session. Any member may make the motion to reconsider, when the yeas and nays have not been taken. If the Senate refuse to reconsider, or upon reconsideration shall affirm its first decision, no further motion to reconsider shall be in order. No vote shall be reconsidered upon motions to adjourn, to lay on the table, to take from the table or for the previous question. The motion to reconsider may be put and acted upon when made. If seconded, it shall take precedence of all other questions, except the consideration of a conference report and the motion to adjourn, and unless by motion postponed until some future date be acted upon at once. When a motion to reconsider is made and not acted upon at the time, it shall be placed upon the calendar, under unfinished business, and be acted upon the next succeeding day of actual session. A motion to reconsider shall not be withdrawn without leave of the Senate. No bill, resolution, message, report, amendment or motion, upon which a motion is pending to reconsider the vote thereon, shall be taken out of the possession of the Senate until final disposition of the motion to reconsider. No motion for reconsideration of the vote on any question, which has gone out of the possession of the Senate, shall be in order unless subsequently recalled by vote of the Senate and in possession of the Clerk. When a motion to reconsider has been adopted, its effect shall be to place before the Senate the original question in the exact position it occupied before it was voted upon. VOTING43. Every member within the Chamber, when a question is put, shall vote unless he or she is immediately and particularly interested therein, meaning an interest that affects the member directly and not as one of a class, or the Senate excuses him or her. A member may raise an inquiry to the presiding officer regarding whether he or she should not vote or should be excused from voting on a particular matter, but the member may still be required to vote.

Upon any such objection the presiding officer shall inquire of the membership if the demand for the yeas and nays is sustained. If the demand is so sustained by one tenth of the members present, the yeas and nays shall be taken, and, if the demand is not sustained by one tenth of the members present, then the yeas and nays shall not be taken. The result of all votes taken by yeas and nays shall be recorded in the Journal. When the yeas and nays are recorded in the Journal, the result of the vote as to total yeas, nays and absentees shall be recorded, with the names of the Senators voting yea or nay, and those absent.

After completion of a roll call vote, no member shall speak to explain his or her vote. A member's vote explanation shall not be recorded in the daily Journal. A member may have his or her vote explanation recorded in the bound Journal provided the member obtains the floor and makes this request immediately following announcement of the results of the roll call vote and disposition of the matter and delivers his or her written vote explanation to the Clerk within three legislative days during the session or, if there are less than three legislative days remaining in the session, within seventy-two hours after adjournment sine die. The Clerk shall note on the daily Journal for the day of the roll call vote that the member has reserved the privilege of having his or her vote explanation recorded later in the bound Journal. 45. On all roll calls of the yeas and nays when the voting machine is not used, and before the result is announced, the Clerk shall at the request of any member read either the names of those who voted yea or of those who voted nay, whichever is the smaller number, and the names of those absent and not voting, if any, and shall announce that all others voted either yea or nay, whichever is the larger number. In the event of a tie vote, the Clerk shall upon such request read the names of those who voted yea and the names of those absent and not voting, if any, and shall announce that all others voted nay. At that time any member shall have the right to correct any mistake committed in enrolling his or her name. The vote then shall be announced and the count recorded in the Journal. 45a. The voting machine may be used in taking the yeas and nays on any question, including quorum calls. When the machine is used for quorum calls, a member shall indicate "present" by use of the green "yea" button. When using the voting machine, the presiding officer shall announce the question to be voted upon and direct the Clerk to prepare the machine. The presiding officer shall then state, "The members will now vote." After reasonable time has been given for all members to vote, the presiding officer shall ask, "Have all members voted?" The presiding officer shall then direct the Clerk to close the machine and ascertain the result. The presiding officer shall promptly announce the result. Voting shall be continuous and shall be permitted until the result thereof is announced by the presiding officer: Provided, That any vote cast after the machine has been closed shall be stated by the presiding officer as having been cast and such shall be recorded in the Journal: Provided, however, That no vote may be cast after the vote has been announced. While the members are voting and before the machine is closed, the wall display boards shall continuously display the vote of each member and the total pending vote.
