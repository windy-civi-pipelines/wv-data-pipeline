All amounts deposited in the fund shall be pledged, as designated by the authority, to the repayment of the principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, on revenue bonds or refunding revenue bonds authorized by §18-9D-4b of this code.

The Legislature further finds and declares that this section, as well as §29-22-18 of this code, had been reenacted during the first extraordinary session of the West Virginia Legislature in the year 1994 in an attempt to comply with the holding of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia.The Legislature further finds and declares that it intends, through the reenactment of this section and §29-22-18 of this code, to dedicate a source of state revenues to special revenue funds for the purposes of paying the debt service on bonds and refunding bonds issued subsequent to January 1, 1994, the proceeds of which will be used for the construction and improvement of school building facilities and maintenance of school buildings, land, and equipment. The Legislature further finds and declares that it intends, through the reenactment of this section and §11-15-30 of this code and §29-22-18 of this code, to appropriate revenues to two special revenue funds for the purposes of construction and improvement of school building facilities. Furthermore, the Legislature intends to encourage county boards to maintain existing levels of county funding for construction, improvement, and maintenance of school building facilities and to generate additional county funds for those purposes through bonds and special levies whenever possible. The Legislature further encourages the School Building Maintenance Authority, the state board and county boards of education to propose uniform project specifications for comparable projects whenever possible to meet county needs at the lowest possible cost.The Legislature further finds and declares that it intends, through the reenactment of this section and §29-22-18 of this code, to comply with the provisions of sections four and six, article X of the Constitution of West Virginia; and section one, article XII of said Constitution. §18-9D-7. Authority to fix and collect rents. The authority may fix and collect a rental fee for the use of all or any part of a capital improvement project completed under this article to provide revenues for deposit in the School Construction Fund to pay, in whole or in part, the principal of, interest and redemption premium, if any, on the bonds authorized to be issued pursuant to this article as the same mature and become due and to make all reserve and other payments to be required by the proceedings which authorize these bonds; to provide any additional protective pledge of revenues and reserve or other payments as the School Building Maintenance Authority may require by the resolution authorizing any issue of bonds pursuant to this article and any trust agreement made in connection therewith; and to make any other payments required or authorized by this article or any proceedings, resolutions or trust agreements authorized hereunder. §18-9D-8. Use of proceeds of bonds; bonds exempt from taxation. (a) The maximum aggregate amount of bonds outstanding at any time, for which the moneys in the School Building Debt Service Fund or the Excess Lottery School Building Debt Service Fund are to be pledged, is $500 million; however, any amount of bonds for which moneys have been deposited in a sinking fund, reserve fund or other fund established to provide payment of principal or interest on the bonds shall be excluded from the calculation of the maximum aggregate amount of bonds outstanding at any time. The issuance of revenue bonds under this article shall be authorized, from time to time, by resolution or resolutions of the School Building Maintenance Authority, copies of which shall be provided to the Governor, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Delegates within five days of their approval, which shall set forth the proposed projects authorized in accordance with §18-9D-16 of this code as well as the financing of school building, land, and equipment maintenance costs and provide for the issuance of bonds in amounts sufficient, when sold as provided in this section, to provide moneys considered sufficient by the authority to pay the costs, less the amounts of any other funds available for the costs or from any appropriation, grant or gift for the costs: Provided, That bond issues from which bond revenues are to be distributed in accordance with §18-9D-15 of this code for projects authorized pursuant to §18-9D-16 of this code and distributed for maintenance of school buildings, land, and equipment are not required to set forth the proposed projects in the resolution. The resolution shall prescribe the rights and duties of the bondholders and the School Building Maintenance Authority and, for that purpose, may prescribe the form of the trust agreement referred to in this section. The bonds may be issued, from time to time, in such amounts; shall be of such series; bear such date or dates; mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their respective dates; bear interest at such rate or rates; be in such denominations; be in such form, either coupon or registered, carrying such registration, exchangeability and interchangeability privileges; be payable in such medium of payment and at such place or places within or without the state; be subject to such terms of redemption at such prices not exceeding 105 percent of the principal amount of the bonds; and be entitled to the priorities on the revenues paid into the fund pledged for repayment of the bonds as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in any trust agreement made in connection with the bonds: Provided, however, That revenue bonds issued on or after January 1, 2008, which are secured by lottery proceeds from §29-22-18 or §29-22-18a of this code, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 20 years from their respective dates.(b) The bonds shall be signed by the Governor, his or her designee or the vice chair of the authority, under the great seal of the state, attested by the Secretary of State, and the coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the Governor, his or her designee or the vice chair of the authority. If any of the officers whose signatures appear on the bonds or coupons cease to be officers before the delivery of the bonds, the signatures shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if the officers had remained in office until the delivery. The revenue bonds shall be sold in the manner determined by the authority to be for the best interests of the State.(c) The proceeds of any bonds shall be used solely for the purpose or purposes as may be generally or specifically set forth in the resolution authorizing those bonds and shall be disbursed in the manner and with the restrictions, if any, that the authority provides in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement referred to in this section securing the bonds.

The School Major Improvement Fund shall be an interest-bearing account, with interest being credited to and deposited in the School Major Improvement Fund and expended in accordance with the provisions of this article, including maintenance of school buildings, land, and equipment.(e) There is created in the State Treasury a special revenue fund named the Excess Lottery School Building Debt Service Fund into which shall be deposited the amounts specified in §29-22-18a of this code. All amounts deposited in the fund shall be pledged, as designated by the authority, to the repayment of the principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, on revenue bonds or refunding revenue bonds authorized by §18-9D-4b of this code. On or prior to May 1 of each year, the authority shall certify to the state Lottery Director the principal and interest and coverage ratio requirements for the following fiscal year on any revenue bonds issued for which moneys deposited in the Excess Lottery School Building Debt Service Fund have been pledged, or will be pledged, for repayment pursuant to this section.After the authority has issued bonds authorized by this article for which moneys deposited in the Excess Lottery School Building Debt Service Fund have been pledged and after the requirements of all funds have been satisfied, including coverage and reserve funds established in connection with the bonds issued pursuant to this article, any balance remaining in the Excess Lottery School Building Debt Service Fund may be used for the redemption of any of the outstanding bonds issued under this article, for which moneys deposited in the Excess Lottery School Building Debt Service Fund have been pledged, which, by their terms, are then redeemable or for the purchase of the outstanding bonds at the market price, but not to exceed the price, if any, at which the bonds are redeemable and all bonds redeemed or purchased shall may be immediately canceled and may not again be issued: Provided, That after the authority has issued bonds authorized by this article and after the requirements of debt service and all associated funds have been satisfied for the fiscal year, including coverage and reserve funds established in connection with the bonds issued pursuant to this article for which moneys deposited in the Excess Lottery School Building Debt Service Fund have been pledged, any remaining balance in the Excess Lottery School Building Debt Service Fund may be transferred to the School Construction Fund created in subsection (c) of this section and used by the School Building Maintenance Authority in its discretion to finance the cost of school construction or improvement projects authorized in accordance with the provisions of §18-9D-16 of this code or maintenance of school buildings, land, or equipment on a cash basis.(f) Beginning for fiscal year 2024 and each fiscal year thereafter, the School Building Authority shall annually request the Governor to include in the budget bill an amount equal to $24 million for appropriation to the agency’s General Revenue Fund.  These funds shall be transferred to the School Construction Fund and used for purposes set out within subsection (e) of this section.(g) The Legislature finds and declares that the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia has held that the issuance of additional revenue bonds authorized under the School Building Authority Act, as enacted in this article prior to July 20, 1993, constituted an indebtedness of the state in violation of section four, article X of the Constitution of West Virginia, but that revenue bonds issued under this article prior to July 20, 1993, are not invalid.The Legislature further finds and declares that the financial capacity of a county to construct, lease, and improve, and maintain school facilities depends upon the county's bonding capacity (local property wealth), voter willingness to pass bond issues and the county's ability to reallocate other available county funds instead of criteria related to educational needs or upon the ability of the School Building Maintenance Authority created in this article to issue bonds that comply with the holding of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals or otherwise assist counties with the financing of facilities construction and improvement. The Legislature further finds and declares that this section, as well as §29-22-18 of this code, had been reenacted during the first extraordinary session of the West Virginia Legislature in the year 1994 in an attempt to comply with the holding of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia.The Legislature further finds and declares that it intends, through the reenactment of this section and §29-22-18 of this code, to dedicate a source of state revenues to special revenue funds for the purposes of paying the debt service on bonds and refunding bonds issued subsequent to January 1, 1994, the proceeds of which will be used for the construction and improvement of school building facilities and maintenance of school buildings, land, and equipment. The Legislature further finds and declares that it intends, through the reenactment of this section and §11-15-30 of this code and §29-22-18 of this code, to appropriate revenues to two special revenue funds for the purposes of construction and improvement of school building facilities. Furthermore, the Legislature intends to encourage county boards to maintain existing levels of county funding for construction, improvement, and maintenance of school building facilities and to generate additional county funds for those purposes through bonds and special levies whenever possible. The Legislature further encourages the School Building Maintenance Authority, the state board and county boards of education to propose uniform project specifications for comparable projects whenever possible to meet county needs at the lowest possible cost.The Legislature further finds and declares that it intends, through the reenactment of this section and §29-22-18 of this code, to comply with the provisions of sections four and six, article X of the Constitution of West Virginia; and section one, article XII of said Constitution. §18-9D-7. Authority to fix and collect rents. The authority may fix and collect a rental fee for the use of all or any part of a capital improvement project completed under this article to provide revenues for deposit in the School Construction Fund to pay, in whole or in part, the principal of, interest and redemption premium, if any, on the bonds authorized to be issued pursuant to this article as the same mature and become due and to make all reserve and other payments to be required by the proceedings which authorize these bonds; to provide any additional protective pledge of revenues and reserve or other payments as the School Building Maintenance Authority may require by the resolution authorizing any issue of bonds pursuant to this article and any trust agreement made in connection therewith; and to make any other payments required or authorized by this article or any proceedings, resolutions or trust agreements authorized hereunder. §18-9D-8. Use of proceeds of bonds; bonds exempt from taxation. (a) The maximum aggregate amount of bonds outstanding at any time, for which the moneys in the School Building Debt Service Fund or the Excess Lottery School Building Debt Service Fund are to be pledged, is $500 million; however, any amount of bonds for which moneys have been deposited in a sinking fund, reserve fund or other fund established to provide payment of principal or interest on the bonds shall be excluded from the calculation of the maximum aggregate amount of bonds outstanding at any time. The issuance of revenue bonds under this article shall be authorized, from time to time, by resolution or resolutions of the School Building Maintenance Authority, copies of which shall be provided to the Governor, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Delegates within five days of their approval, which shall set forth the proposed projects authorized in accordance with §18-9D-16 of this code as well as the financing of school building, land, and equipment maintenance costs and provide for the issuance of bonds in amounts sufficient, when sold as provided in this section, to provide moneys considered sufficient by the authority to pay the costs, less the amounts of any other funds available for the costs or from any appropriation, grant or gift for the costs: Provided, That bond issues from which bond revenues are to be distributed in accordance with §18-9D-15 of this code for projects authorized pursuant to §18-9D-16 of this code and distributed for maintenance of school buildings, land, and equipment are not required to set forth the proposed projects in the resolution. The resolution shall prescribe the rights and duties of the bondholders and the School Building Maintenance Authority and, for that purpose, may prescribe the form of the trust agreement referred to in this section. The bonds may be issued, from time to time, in such amounts; shall be of such series; bear such date or dates; mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their respective dates; bear interest at such rate or rates; be in such denominations; be in such form, either coupon or registered, carrying such registration, exchangeability and interchangeability privileges; be payable in such medium of payment and at such place or places within or without the state; be subject to such terms of redemption at such prices not exceeding 105 percent of the principal amount of the bonds; and be entitled to the priorities on the revenues paid into the fund pledged for repayment of the bonds as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in any trust agreement made in connection with the bonds: Provided, however, That revenue bonds issued on or after January 1, 2008, which are secured by lottery proceeds from §29-22-18 or §29-22-18a of this code, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 20 years from their respective dates.(b) The bonds shall be signed by the Governor, his or her designee or the vice chair of the authority, under the great seal of the state, attested by the Secretary of State, and the coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the Governor, his or her designee or the vice chair of the authority. If any of the officers whose signatures appear on the bonds or coupons cease to be officers before the delivery of the bonds, the signatures shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if the officers had remained in office until the delivery. The revenue bonds shall be sold in the manner determined by the authority to be for the best interests of the State.(c) The proceeds of any bonds shall be used solely for the purpose or purposes as may be generally or specifically set forth in the resolution authorizing those bonds and shall be disbursed in the manner and with the restrictions, if any, that the authority provides in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement referred to in this section securing the bonds. If the proceeds of the bonds, by error in calculations or otherwise, are less than the cost of any projects or maintenance specifically set forth in the resolution, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of the deficiency; and unless otherwise provided for in the resolution or trust agreement hereinafter mentioned, the additional bonds shall be considered to be of the same issue and are entitled to payment from the same fund, without preference or priority, as the bonds before issued for the projects. If the proceeds of bonds issued for the projects specifically set forth in the resolution authorizing the bonds issued by the authority exceed the cost of the bonds, the surplus may be used for any other projects authorized in accordance with §18-9D-16 of this code or in any other manner that the resolution authorizing the bonds provides. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue temporary bonds with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the definitive bonds.(d) After the issuance of any revenue bonds, the revenues pledged for the revenue bonds may not be reduced as long as any of the revenue bonds are outstanding and unpaid except under the terms, provisions and conditions that are contained in the resolution, trust agreement or other proceedings under which the revenue bonds were issued.(e) The revenue bonds and the revenue refunding bonds and bonds issued for combined purposes, together with the interest on the bonds, are exempt from all taxation by the State of West Virginia, or by any county, school district, municipality, or political subdivision thereof.(f) Any school construction bonds issued under this section shall be issued on parity with any existing School Building Authority bonds previously issued under this article. §18-9D-9. Issuance of revenue refunding bonds; use of moneys; power to enter into escrow agreements; call for redemption. The issuance of revenue refunding bonds under the provisions of this article shall be authorized by resolution of the School Building Maintenance Authority and shall otherwise be subject to the limitations, conditions, and provisions of other revenue bonds under this article. The revenue refunding bonds may be issued in an amount at the option of the authority sufficient to pay either in part or in full, together with interest earned on the investment of the proceeds thereof, whether or not at the time of the issuance of the revenue refunding bonds the hereafter mentioned bonds are payable or callable for optional redemption: (1) The principal of the outstanding bonds; (2) the redemption premium, if any, on the outstanding bonds if they are to be redeemed prior to maturity; (3) the interest due and payable on the outstanding bonds to and including the maturity date thereof or the first date upon which the outstanding bonds are to be redeemed, including any interest theretofore accrued and unpaid; and (4) all expenses of the issuance and sale of said revenue refunding bonds, including all necessary financial and legal expenses, and also including the creation of initial debt service reserve funds. Any existing moneys pledged with respect to the outstanding bonds may be used for any or all of the purposes stated in (1), (2), (3) and (4) above or may be deposited in a sinking fund or reserve fund or other funds for the issue of bonds which have been issued wholly or in part for the purpose of such refunding. Such amount of the proceeds of the revenue refunding bonds as shall be sufficient for the payment of the principal, interest and redemption premium, if any, on the outstanding bonds which will not be immediately due and payable shall be deposited in trust, for the sole purpose of making such payments, in a banking institution chosen by the authority and in accordance with any provisions which may be included in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the same. Any of the moneys so deposited in trust may, prior to the date on which such moneys will be needed for the payment of principal of, interest and redemption premium, if any, on the outstanding bonds, be invested and reinvested as determined by the authority, in whole or in part: (a) In direct obligations issued by the United States of America or one of its agencies or in direct obligations of the state of West Virginia; (b) in obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America as to principal and interest; or (c) in certificates of deposit of a banking corporation or association which is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation, or successor; but any such certificates of deposit must be fully secured as to both principal and interest by pledged collateral consisting of direct obligations of or obligations guaranteed by the United States of America, or direct obligations of the state of West Virginia, having a market value, excluding accrued interest, at all times at least equal to the amount of the principal of and accrued interest on the certificates of deposit. Any such investments must mature, or be payable in advance of maturity at the option of the holder, and shall bear interest in such manner as to provide funds which, together with uninvested money, will be sufficient to pay when due or called for redemption the bonds refunded, together with interest accrued and to accrue thereon and redemption premiums, if any, and the refunding bonds' proceeds or obligations so purchased therewith shall be deposited in escrow and held in trust for the payment and redemption of the bonds refunded: Provided, That if interest earned by any investment in the escrow is shown to be in excess of the amounts required from time to time for the payment of interest on and principal of the refunded bonds, including applicable redemption premium, then the excess may be withdrawn from escrow and disbursed in such manner as the authority shall by resolution determine. Any moneys in the sinking or reserve funds or other funds maintained for the outstanding bonds to be refunded may be applied in the same manner and for the same purpose as are the net proceeds of refunding bonds or may be deposited in the special fund or any reserve funds established for account of the refunding bonds.The authority to issue revenue refunding bonds shall be in addition to any other authority to refund bonds conferred by law.The School Building Maintenance Authority may enter into such escrow agreements with such bank or banks and to insert therein such protective and other covenants and provisions as it may consider necessary to permit the carrying out of the provisions of this article and to ensure the prompt payment of the principal of and interest and redemption premiums on the revenue bonds refunded.Where any revenue bonds to be refunded are not to be surrendered for exchange or payment and are not to be paid at maturity with escrowed obligations, but are to be paid from such source prior to maturity pursuant to call for redemption exercised under a right of redemption reserved in such revenue bonds, the authority shall, prior to the issuance of the refunding bonds, determine which redemption date or dates shall be used, call the revenue bonds for redemption and provide for the giving of the notice of redemption required by the proceedings authorizing the revenue bonds. Where notice is to be given at a time subsequent to the issuance of the refunding bonds, the necessary notices may be deposited with the State Treasurer or the bank acting as escrow agent of the refunding bond proceeds and the escrow agent appropriately instructed and authorized to give the required notices at the prescribed time or times. If any officer of the public body signing any such notice shall no longer be in office at the time of the utilization of the notice, the notice shall nevertheless be valid and effective for its intended purpose. §18-9D-10. Bonds may be issued for combined purposes. The School Building Maintenance Authority may authorize by one or more resolutions a single issue of bonds for the combined purposes of refunding the outstanding bonds as herein authorized and financing one or more of the projects authorized hereunder. §18-9D-12. Trust agreements for holders of bonds. The School Building Maintenance Authority may enter into an agreement or agreements with any trust company, or with any bank having the powers of a trust company, either within or outside the state, to act as trustee for the holders of bonds issued hereunder, setting forth therein such duties and containing such legally binding covenants of the School Building Maintenance Authority with the holders of the bonds in respect to the payment of the bond; the fixing and collecting of rents hereinbefore referred to; the completion of authorized projects; the custody, safeguarding and disposition of the proceeds of the bonds, and the moneys in such special funds, sinking funds, reserve funds, or any other moneys or funds, notwithstanding provisions of this article to the contrary; the security for moneys on hand or on deposit, and the rights and remedies of the trustee and the holders of the bonds, as may be agreed upon with the purchasers of such bonds; provisions restricting the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust agreements respecting bonds and debentures of municipal corporations, protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the trustee and the bondholders; and provisions as to any other matters which are deemed necessary and advisable by the School Building Maintenance Authority in the best interests of the state and to enhance the marketability of the bonds. Any such agreement entered into by the School Building Maintenance Authority shall be binding in all respects on such authority and its successors from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof; and all the provisions thereof shall be enforceable by appropriate proceedings at law or in equity, or otherwise. §18-9D-13. Payment of bonds. From the School Building Debt Service Fund or the Excess Lottery School Building Debt Service Fund, the authority shall make periodic payments in an amount sufficient to meet the requirements of any issue of bonds sold under the provisions of this article and for which the authority has pledged revenues in the fund for the payment of the bonds, as may be specified in the resolution of the authority authorizing the issue thereof or in any trust agreement entered into in connection therewith. The payments so made shall be placed as specified in the resolution or trust agreement in a special sinking fund which is hereby pledged to and charged with the payment of the principal of the bonds of the issue and the interest thereon, and to the redemption or repurchase of the bonds, the sinking fund to be a fund for all bonds of the particular issue without distinction or priority of one over another, except as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds. The moneys in the special sinking fund, less the reserve for payment of principal and interest and redemption premium, if any, as may be required by the resolution of the School Building Maintenance Authority authorizing the issue or any trust agreement made in connection therewith, may be used for redemption of any of the outstanding bonds payable from the fund which by their terms are then redeemable, or for the purchase of bonds at the market price, but not exceeding the price, if any, at which the bonds shall in the same year be redeemable; and all bonds redeemed or purchased shall forthwith be canceled and may not again be issued. §18-9D-14. Credit of state not pledged. No provisions of this article shall be construed to authorize the School Building Maintenance Authority at any time or in any manner to pledge the credit or taxing power of the state, nor shall any of the obligations or debts created by the School Building Maintenance Authority under the authority herein granted be deemed to be obligations of the state. §18-9D-15.
