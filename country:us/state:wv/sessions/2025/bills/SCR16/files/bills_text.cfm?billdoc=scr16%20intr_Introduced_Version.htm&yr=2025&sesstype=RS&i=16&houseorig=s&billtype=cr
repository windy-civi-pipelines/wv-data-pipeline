S. Army SPC Johnny Long Memorial Bridge".Whereas, Johnny Long was born June 21, 1948, in Boone County; andWhereas, Johnny Long, a proud son of Julian, West Virginia, spent his early years along the banks of the Little Coal River, where he formed a deep connection with the land that would shape his life. He built his home in Lincoln County, but his commitment to hard work led him to the coal mines of Boone County, where he labored until the historic strike of 1978. Johnny Long left the mines and transitioned to bridge construction, joining Vecellio & Grogan as a skilled carpenter during the monumental building of Corridor G. It was there that he honed his craft, contributing to the erection of every bridge from Julian to Ruth, marking each one with his dedication and expertise. Over the course of 27 years, Johnny Long stood as a proud member of the United Steel Workers Union Local 14614, embodying the values of hard work, perseverance, and craftsmanship throughout his career. His legacy endures in the many bridges he helped bring to life and the lasting impact he made on his community; andWhereas, U.S. Army Specialist Johnny Long was a highly decorated veteran who proudly served his country with distinction. As a member of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment during the Vietnam War, he bravely flew more than thirteen missions under fire with the revered “Air Cav.” For his unwavering courage and dedication in the face of danger, Specialist Long was awarded the prestigious U.S. Army Air Medal. His exemplary service earned him further recognition with numerous honors, including the Bronze Star, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, and Vietnam Service Medal. He also wore the Combat Infantry Badge with pride, a testament to his battlefield valor, and was recognized as an Expert Marksman with both the 106mm and 90mm mortars, as well as the rifle.
