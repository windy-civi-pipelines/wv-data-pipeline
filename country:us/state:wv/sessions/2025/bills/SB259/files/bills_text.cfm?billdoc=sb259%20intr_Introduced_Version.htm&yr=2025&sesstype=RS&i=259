Red = new code to be enacted WEST virginia legislature2025 regular session FISCAL NOTE IntroducedSenate Bill 259By Senator Stuart[Introduced February 12, 2025; referred to the Committee on Government Organization; and then to the Committee on Finance]A BILL to amend the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, by adding a new section, designated §47-23-5, relating to licensing the sale of charitable raffles and boards to benefit volunteer fire departments in this state; explaining the legislative purpose; setting forth the licensure requirement; providing the agency to issue licenses; providing for the designation of proceeds from the sale of charitable raffle boards and games; clarifying the county option; authorizing the state to contract with distributors to effectuate sales of charitable raffle boards and games; and providing for enforceability.Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia: ARTICLE 23. CHARITABLE RAFFLE BOARDS AND GAMES. §47-23-5. Legislative purpose; licensure requirement for retailers; designation of proceeds; miscellaneous provisions; enforcement authority. (a) Legislative purpose. – There is no provision within §47-23-1 et seq. to regulate the retail sale of charitable raffle boards and games. Furthermore, the proceeds of charitable raffle boards and games are not required to benefit charitable or public service organizations in this state.  As a consequence, unlicensed sellers of charitable raffle boards and games are able to keep the proceeds from the sales of charitable raffle boards and games and are not required to remit the net proceeds of these sales to licensed charitable or public service organizations as is required for charitable bingo under §47-20-1 et seq. and charitable raffles under §47-21-1 et seq.  Volunteer Fire Departments in this state have faced rising costs simply to operate and provide services to the community. Neighboring states, such as Ohio, which has licensed the sale of charitable raffle boards and games by retailers for more than a decade, generate millions of dollars for licensed charitable organizations every year.  By licensing persons in West Virginia to sell charitable raffle boards and games and exclusively dedicating the net proceeds of these sales to benefit Volunteer Fire Departments, then Volunteer Fire Departments will have a reliable and dedicated source of funding for their critical public safety services. This will also reduce or eliminate the sales of charitable raffle boards and games by unlicensed sellers which do not share the net proceeds of the sales with charitable or public service organizations in this state. (b) Licensure requirement for the sale of charitable raffle boards and games. – After enactment of this amendment, no person in this state shall sell charitable raffle boards or games unless that person is registered to do business in this state pursuant to the provisions of §11-12-1 et seq. and is licensed to sell charitable raffle boards and games as provided herein.
