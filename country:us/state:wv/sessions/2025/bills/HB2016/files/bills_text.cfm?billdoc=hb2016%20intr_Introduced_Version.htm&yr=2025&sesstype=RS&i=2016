References to funding sources and current placement authority for the targeted populations of children and youth are for the purpose of accounting for the funds in the pool. It is not intended that children and youth be categorized by individual funding streams in order to access services. The target population shall be the following:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(1) Children and youth placed for purposes of special education in approved private school educational programs, previously funded by the Department of Education through private tuition assistance;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(2) Children and youth with disabilities placed by local social services agencies or the Division of Juvenile services pursuant to &sect;49-2-901 through &sect;49-2-919 of this code in private residential facilities or across jurisdictional lines in private, special education day schools, if the individualized education program indicates such school is the appropriate placement while living in foster homes or child-caring facilities, previously funded by the Department of Education through the Interagency Assistance Fund for Noneducational Placements of Handicapped Children;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(3) Children and youth for whom foster care services, as defined by &sect;49-4-110 of this code, are being provided;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(4) Children and youth placed by the Division of Juvenile services pursuant to &sect;49-2-901 through &sect;49-2-919 of this code and family court, in a private or locally operated public facility or nonresidential program, or in a community or facility-based treatment program;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(5) Children and youth committed to the Division of Juvenile services pursuant to &sect;49-2-901 through &sect;49-2-919 of this code placed by it in a private home or in a public or private facility; and</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(6) Children and youth previously placed in approved private school educational programs for at least six months who will receive transitional services in a public school setting. State pool funds shall be allocated for no longer than 12 months for transitional services. Local agencies may contract with a private school education program provider to provide transition services in the public school.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(c) The Legislature and the governing body of each county and municipality shall annually appropriate such sums of money as shall be sufficient to (1) provide special education services and foster care services for children and youth identified and (2) meet relevant federal mandates for the provision of these services. The community policy and management team shall anticipate to the best of its ability the number of children and youth for whom such services will be required and reserve funds from its state pool allocation to meet these needs. Nothing in this section prohibits local governments from requiring parental or legal financial contributions, where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law or regulation, utilizing a standard sliding fee scale based upon ability to pay, as provided in the appropriation act.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(d) When a community services board established, local school division, local social service agency, court service unit, or the Division of Juvenile services pursuant to &sect;49-2-901 through &sect;49-2-919 of this code has referred a child and family to a family assessment and planning team and that team has recommended the proper level of treatment and services needed by that child and family and has determined the child&#39;s eligibility for funding for services through the state pool of funds, then the community services board, the local school division, local social services agency, court service unit, or Department of Juvenile Justice has met its fiscal responsibility for that child for the services funded through the pool. However, the community services board, the local school division, local social services agency, court service unit, or Department of Juvenile Justice continues to be responsible for providing services identified in individual family service plans that are within the agency&#39;s scope of responsibility and that are funded separately from the state pool.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">Further, in any instance that an individual 18 through 21 years of age, inclusive, who is eligible for funding from the state pool and is properly defined as a school-aged child with disabilities is placed by a local social services agency that has custody across jurisdictional lines in a group home in the State and the individual&#39;s individualized education program (IEP), as prepared by the placing jurisdiction, indicates that a private day school placement is the appropriate educational program for such individual, the financial and legal responsibility for the individual&#39;s special education services and IEP shall remain, in compliance with the provisions of federal law, Article 2 of Chapter 13 of Title 22.1, and Board of Education regulations, the responsibility of the placing jurisdiction until the individual reaches the age of 21, inclusive, or is no longer eligible for special education services. The financial and legal responsibility for such special education services shall remain with the placing jurisdiction, unless the placing jurisdiction has transitioned all appropriate services with the individual.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(e) In any matter properly before a court for which state pool funds are to be accessed, the court shall, prior to final disposition, and refer the matter to the community policy and management team for assessment by a local family assessment and planning team authorized by policies of the community policy and management team for assessment to determine the recommended level of treatment and services needed by the child and family. The family assessment and planning team making the assessment shall make a report of the case or forward a copy of the individual family services plan to the court within 30 days of the court&#39;s written referral to the community policy and management team. The court shall consider the recommendations of the family assessment and planning team and the community policy and management team. If, prior to a final disposition by the court, the court is requested to consider a level of service not identified or recommended in the report submitted by the family assessment and planning team, the court shall request the community policy and management team to submit a second report characterizing comparable levels of service to the requested level of service. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the court may make any disposition as is authorized or required by law. Services ordered pursuant to a disposition rendered by the court pursuant to this section shall qualify for funding as appropriated under this section.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csF2E808A1">(f) As used in this section, &quot;transitional services&quot; includes services delivered in a public school setting directly to students with significant disabilities or intensive support needs to facilitate their transition back to public school after having been served in a private special education day school or residential facility for at least six months. &quot;Transitional services&quot; includes one-on-one aides, speech therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral health services, counseling, applied behavior analysis, specially designed instruction delivered directly to the student, or other services needed to facilitate such transition that are delivered directly to the student in their public school over the 12-month period as identified in the child&#39;s individualized education program.</span></p><p class="csDE8452F9"><span class="csAD690475">NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to create the Comprehensive Services Act, a collaborative system of services and funding that is child-centered, family-focused and community-based when addressing the strengths and needs of troubled and at-risk youths and their families in this state.</span></p><p class="csDE8452F9"><span class="csAD690475">Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.</span></p>
