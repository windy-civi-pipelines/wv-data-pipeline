For purposes of this subdivision, a person is exempt from the tax imposed by this article only if such person is, by reason of that person's purpose or activities, exempt from paying federal income taxes on such person’s West Virginia source income. The pass-through entity may rely on the written statement of the person claiming to be exempt from the tax imposed by this article provided the pass-through entity discloses the name and federal taxpayer identification number for all such persons in its return for the taxable year filed under this article or §11-24-1 et seq. of this code; or(2) On distributions to a corporation which is exempt from the tax imposed by §11-24-1 et seq. of this code.

The Tax Commissioner may prescribe the form and contents of such a petition and specify standards for when a pass-through entity will not be required to comply with the withholding requirements of this section due to undue hardship. Such standards shall take into account (among other relevant factors) the ability of a pass-through entity to comply at reasonable cost with the withholding requirements of this section and the cost to this state of collecting the tax directly from a nonresident distributee who does not voluntarily file a return and pay the amount of tax due under this article with respect to such distributions; or(4) On distributions by nonpartnership ventures. An unincorporated organization that has elected, under Section 761 of the Internal Revenue Code, to not be treated as a partnership for federal income tax is not treated as a partnership under this article and is not required to withhold under this section. However, such unincorporated organizations shall make and file with the Tax Commissioner a true and accurate return of information under §11-21-58(c) of this code, under such rules and in such form and manner as the Tax Commissioner may prescribe, setting forth: (A) The amount of fixed or determinable gains, profits, and income; and (B) the name, address and taxpayer identification number of persons receiving fixed or determinable gains, profits or income from the nonpartnership venture.(5) Publicly traded partnerships. — A publicly traded partnership, as defined in §11-21A-1 of this code, that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year, is exempt from the withholding requirements of §11-21-71a of this code of this section, if the following information is provided to the Tax Commissioner: The name, address, taxpayer identification number, and West Virginia source income of each partner that had an interest in the publicly traded partnership during the taxable year.

The remaining portion of the tax due under this section, if any, shall be paid at the time the pass-through entity files the return specified in subdivision (1) of this subsection. If the balance due is paid by the last day of the extension period for filing the return and the amount of tax due with such return is 10 percent or less of the tax due under this section for the taxable year, no additions to tax may be imposed under §11-10-1 et seq. of this code with respect to balance so remitted. If the amount of withholding tax due under this section for the taxable year is less than the estimated withholding taxes paid for the taxable year by the pass-through entity, the excess shall be refunded to the pass-through entity or, at its election, established as a credit against withholding tax due under this section for the then current taxable year.(B) Deposit in trust for Tax Commissioner. — The Tax Commissioner may, if the commissioner believes such action is necessary for the protection of trust fund moneys due this state, require any pass-through entity to pay over to the Tax Commissioner the tax deducted and withheld under this section, at any earlier time or times.(e) Effectively connected taxable income. — For purposes of this section, the term "effectively connected taxable income" means the taxable income or portion thereof of a partnership, S corporation, estate or trust, as the case may be, which is derived from or attributable to West Virginia sources as determined under §11-21-32 of this code and such rules as the Tax Commissioner may prescribe, whether the amount is actually distributed or is determined to have been distributed for federal income tax purposes.(f) Treatment of nonresident partners, S corporation shareholders, or beneficiaries of a trust or estate. —(1) Allowance of credit. — Each nonresident partner, nonresident shareholder, or nonresident beneficiary shall be allowed a credit for such partner’s or shareholder’s or beneficiary’s share of the tax withheld by the partnership, S corporation, estate or trust under this section: Provided, That when the distribution is to a corporation taxable under §11-24-1 et seq. of this code, the credit allowed by this section shall be applied against the distributee corporation’s liability for tax under §11-24-1 et seq. of this code.(2) Credit treated as distributed to partner, shareholder, or beneficiary. — Except as provided in rules, a nonresident partner’s share, a nonresident shareholder’s share, or a nonresident beneficiary's share of any withholding tax paid by the partnership, S corporation, estate or trust under this section shall be treated as distributed to the partner by the partnership, or to the shareholder by the S corporation, or to the beneficiary by the estate or trust on the earlier of:(A) The day on which the tax was paid to the Tax Commissioner by the partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust; or(B) The last day of the taxable year for which the tax was paid by the partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust.(g) Regulations. — The Tax Commissioner shall prescribe such rules as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.(h) Information statement. —(1) Every person required to deduct and withhold tax under this section shall furnish to each nonresident partner, or nonresident shareholder, or nonresident beneficiary, as the case may be, a written statement, as prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, showing the amount of West Virginia effectively connected taxable income, whether distributed or not distributed for federal income tax purposes by such partnership, S corporation, estate or trust, to the nonresident partner, or nonresident shareholder, or nonresident beneficiary, the amount deducted and withheld as tax under this section; and such other information as the Tax Commissioner may require.(2) A copy of the information statements required by this subsection shall be filed with the West Virginia return filed under this article (or §11-24-1 et seq. of this code for S corporations) by the pass-through entity for its taxable year to which the distribution relates.

Any amount of tax withheld under this section shall be held in trust for the Tax Commissioner.
