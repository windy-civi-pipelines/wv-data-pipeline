The application shall indicate whether the storage facility contains commercially valuable mineral, including the coal or oil and gas estates, and, if it does, a permit may be issued only if the department is satisfied that the interests of the mineral owners and mineral lessees to the commercially valuable mineral estate will not be adversely affected. The application shall include evidence that the mineral owners, mineral lessees, and operators of any commercially valuable mineral within and contiguous to the proposed carbon sequestration project have been notified in writing by the storage operator of the application, boundaries and horizons for the proposed carbon sequestration project, and a copy of the notice of hearing.

NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to protect coal and gas minerals from carbon capture practices. Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
