RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS FOR STATE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. §18B-12-1. Definitions. The following words used in this article shall, unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning, be construed as follows:(a) "Agreement" means any agreement being entered into between a governing board and a corporation pursuant to section four §18B-12-4 or §18B-12-11 of this article code.(b) "Corporation" means a nonstock, not-for-profit corporation established under the general corporation laws of the state which meets the description presented by section three §18B-12-3 or §18B-12-11 of this article code.(c) "Corporate directors" means the board of directors of a corporation. §18B-12-2.

(a) The Legislature finds and determines that the future economic development in the state will depend in part upon research developed at the state institutions of higher education, and enhanced research opportunities for state institutions of higher education will promote the general economic welfare of the citizens of the state. In order to enhance the competitive position of state institutions of higher education in the current environment for research and development, expenditures for equipment and material for research projects must be handled in an expeditious fashion, and the acquisition and utilization of research grants can be simplified and expedited through the utilization of private corporations.(b) The interest of the citizens of the state will be best met by agreements entered into and carried out by the governing boards and corporations to provide research assistance for state institutions of higher education.
