"Release from an aboveground storage tank," or similar words, means a release of fluids from secondary containment and is not a "leak" into secondary containment. (17) "Secondary containment" means a safeguard applied to one or more aboveground storage tanks that prevents the discharge into the waters of the state of the entire capacity of the largest single tank and sufficient freeboard to contain precipitation. In order to qualify as secondary containment, the barrier and containment field must be sufficiently impervious to contain fluids in the event of a release leak, and may include double-walled tanks, dikes, containment curbs, pits, or drainage trench enclosures that safely confine the release leak from a tank in a facility catchment basin, wastewater treatment plant authorized to receive the tank contents and capable of containing and/or treating it in the event of a leak, or holding pond. Earthen dikes and similar containment structures must be designed and constructed to contain, for a minimum of 72 hours, fluid that escapes from a tank.(18) "Secretary" means the Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection, or his or her designee.(19) "Source water protection area" for a public groundwater supply source is the area within an aquifer that supplies water to a public water supply well within a five-year time of travel and is determined by the mathematical calculation of the locations from which a drop of water placed at the edge of the protection area would theoretically take five years to reach the well.(20) "Zone of critical concern" for a public surface water supply source and for a public surface water influenced groundwater supply source is a corridor along streams within a watershed that warrants detailed scrutiny due to its proximity to the surface water intake and the intake’s susceptibility to potential contaminants within that corridor. The zone of critical concern is determined using a mathematical model that accounts for stream flows, gradient and area topography. The length of the zone of critical concern is based on a five-hour time of travel of water in the streams to the intake. The width of the zone of critical concern is 1,000 feet measured horizontally from each bank of the principal stream and 500 feet measured horizontally from each bank of the tributaries draining into the principal stream: Provided, That, any existing aboveground storage tank located in an area designated as a zone of critical concern on or after July 1, 2025, shall not become a level one regulated aboveground storage tank or be subject to the regulations related thereto for a period of nine months following written notice by certified mail or email sent to the owner or operator of such tanks in the newly-designated zone of critical concern.(21) "Zone of peripheral concern" for a public surface water supply source and for a public surface water influenced groundwater supply source is a corridor along streams within a watershed that warrants scrutiny due to its proximity to the surface water intake and the intake’s susceptibility to potential contaminants within that corridor. The zone of peripheral concern is determined using a mathematical model that accounts for stream flows, gradient, and area topography. The length of the zone of peripheral concern is based on an additional five-hour time of travel of water in the streams beyond the perimeter of the zone of critical concern, which creates a protection zone of 10 hours above the water intake. The width of the zone of peripheral concern is 1,000 feet measured horizontally from each bank of the principal stream and 500 feet measured horizontally from each bank of the tributaries draining into the principal stream: Provided, That, any existing aboveground storage tank located in an area designated as a zone of peripheral concern on or after July 1, 2025, shall not become a level two regulated aboveground storage tank or be subject to the regulations related thereto for a period of nine months following written notice, by certified mail or email sent to the owner or operator of such tanks in the newly-designated zone of peripheral concern.(22) "Leak" means any spilling, emitting, discharging, escaping or leaching of fluids from an aboveground storage tank into secondary containment. Upon the occurrence of a suspected or threatened leak, owners or operators of aboveground storage tanks must report the suspected or threatened leak to the secretary within 24 hours of discovery, unless the owner or operator is able to determine within that time period that the suspected or threatened leak was a false alarm.(23) "Temporarily out-of-service" (TOS) means an emptied aboveground storage tank in which the tank owner or operator has given notice to the Department through the registration process that fluids will not be deposited in the AST. While TOS, an AST is subject only to the registration requirements contained in 22-30-4 of this code, the notice requirements in 22-30-10 of this code, and the signage requirements in 22-30-11 of this code. TOS status ceases at the earlier of (A) closure of the AST, (B) notice of resumption of operational status by amending the registration to show the tank as currently in use; or (C) after five years in TOS status, at which time the owner or operator must return the tank to service or perform closure of the AST. Prior to returning a TOS tank to service an acceptable fit for service inspection performed by a qualified individual as defined in the AST rule shall be submitted to the Agency. §22-30-5. Aboveground Storage Tank Regulatory Program. (a) The secretary shall develop a regulatory program for new and existing regulated aboveground storage tanks and secondary containment that takes into account the size, location and contents of the tanks and sets out tiered requirements for regulated tanks. Level 1 tanks shall be regulated to a higher standard of tank and secondary containment integrity based upon their proximity to a public surface water supply source or public surface water influenced groundwater supply source.(b) The rules promulgated by the secretary for regulated tanks and secondary containment shall, at a minimum, include the following:(1) Criteria for the design, construction and maintenance of aboveground storage tanks; (2) Criteria for the design, construction, maintenance or methods of secondary containment;(3) Criteria for the design, operation, maintenance or methods of leak detection. Acceptable leak detection shall include, but not be limited to, visual inspections, an inventory control system together with tank testing, or a comparable system or method designed to identify leaks from aboveground storage tanks: Provided, That, in the absence of a known release, the secretary may not require inspection of secondary containment or tanks at a greater frequency than once per month; and Provided, however, That the secretary may not require any regulated tanks to be lifted, moved or otherwise physically altered in connection with a visual leak detection program in the absence of a confirmed release; and Provided further, That in addition, the secretary shall allow the use of remote non-destructive examination technologies in connection with any required periodic physical inspections of tanks in order to reduce, to the extent possible, human entry to confined spaces;(4) Requirements for recordkeeping;(5) Requirements for the development of maintenance and corrosion prevention plans;(6) Requirements for the closure of aboveground storage tanks, and any remediation necessary as a result of release from the aboveground storage tank; (7) The assessment of a registration fee, and annual operation and response fees as determined by the secretary;(8) Certificate to operate issuance only after the application and any other supporting documents have been submitted, reviewed and approved by the secretary;(9) A procedure for the administrative resolution of violations including the assessment of administrative civil penalties.(c) For those entities that are otherwise regulated under those provisions of this chapter that necessitate individual, site-specific permits or plans that require appropriate containment and diversionary structures or equipment to prevent discharged or released materials from reaching the waters of the state, the secretary may amend those permits or plans associated with those permits or both at the request of the permittee to include conditions pertaining to the management and control of regulated tanks, so long as those conditions in the opinion of the secretary are sufficient in combination with practices and protections already in place to protect the waters of the state. In its application for permit or plan modification, the permittee shall advise the secretary whether, how and to what extent the permittee adheres to other standards or plans with regard to tank and secondary containment integrity, inspection and spill prevention and response, including, without limitation, API 653 standards for Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration and Reconstruction or STI SP001 Standards for Aboveground Storage Tanks or the requirements of the federal spill prevention and countermeasures program governed by 40 C. F. R. Part 112. Inclusion of ASTs in amended permits or plans would not relieve the owner or operator's responsibility to pay registration, certificate to operate or Protect Our Water Fund fees. Specifically, the permits or plans the secretary may amend include:(1) Permits issued pursuant to the Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act, article three of this chapter;(2) Permits issued by the Office of Oil and Gas pursuant to article six or six-a of this chapter or spill pollution and control measures plans required under 35 C. S. R. 1;(3) Individual permits issued pursuant to the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System, article eleven of this chapter; (4) Permits issued pursuant to the Solid Waste Management Act, article fifteen of this chapter; and(5) Groundwater protection plans issued pursuant to article twelve of this chapter. (d) Any entity whose permit or plan modification or amendment relating to tank integrity and secondary containment design operation and maintenance is approved by the secretary and so maintained shall be deemed to be compliant with this article and entitles the entity to a certificate to operate so long as the registration requirements of section four of this article are also met.(e) The manner and time frames for implementation of the regulatory program required by this section shall be established by the secretary through the proposal of emergency or legislative rules in accordance with the provisions of §29A-3-1 et seq. of this code. §22-30-6. Evaluation and certification. (a) Each regulated aboveground storage tank and its associated secondary containment structure shall be evaluated by a qualified registered professional engineer or a qualified person working under the direct supervision of a registered professional engineer, regulated and licensed by the State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers, or by an individual certified to perform tank inspections by the American Petroleum Institute or the Steel Tank Institute, or by a person holding certification under another program approved by the secretary.(b) Every owner or operator shall submit a certification that each regulated tank and its associated secondary containment structure have been evaluated by a qualified person as set forth in subsection (a) of this section and meets the standards established in accordance with section five of this article.(c) The certification form shall be submitted to the secretary within 180 days of the effective date of the rules establishing standards that are adopted in accordance with section five of this article. Subsequent certifications shall be due at regular intervals thereafter as established by the secretary by legislative rule, but not more frequently than once per calendar year.(d) Any person who performs a tank evaluation in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, a responsible person designated by the owner or operator and any other person designated by the secretary by legislative rule may certify aboveground storage tanks in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.(e) Notwithstanding any subsection in this section, tanks identified under §22-30-3(1)(M) and (N) of this code that are located in a zone of critical concern are exempt from this section, but must be self-inspected and self-certified by its owner or operator at least once per year and reported to the agency; and tanks identified under §22-30-3(1)(M) and (N) of this code that are located in a zone of critical concern are required to have secondary containment inspections performed and documented by the owner or operator at least once per month. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to alter the definition of an aboveground storage tank.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.

R. §§ 355, 372, 302, and 68 in a concentration of one percent or greater, regardless of the AST’s location, except ASTs containing petroleum are not level 1 regulated tanks based solely upon containing constituents recorded on the CERCLA lists; or(C) An AST with a capacity of 50,000 gallons or more, regardless of its contents or location.(14) "Regulated level 2 aboveground storage tank" or "level 2 regulated tank" means an AST that is located within a zone of peripheral concern that is not a level 1 regulated tank, or a tank identified under §22-30-3(1)(M) or (N) of this code that is in a zone of critical concern.(15) "Regulated aboveground storage tank" or "regulated tank" means an AST that meets the definition of a level 1 or level 2 regulated tank.(16) "Release" means any spilling, leaking, emitting, discharging, escaping, or leaching of fluids from an aboveground storage tank secondary containment, or from a tank where there is no secondary containment, into the waters of the state or escaping from secondary containment. "Release from an aboveground storage tank," or similar words, means a release of fluids from secondary containment and is not a "leak" into secondary containment. (17) "Secondary containment" means a safeguard applied to one or more aboveground storage tanks that prevents the discharge into the waters of the state of the entire capacity of the largest single tank and sufficient freeboard to contain precipitation. In order to qualify as secondary containment, the barrier and containment field must be sufficiently impervious to contain fluids in the event of a release leak, and may include double-walled tanks, dikes, containment curbs, pits, or drainage trench enclosures that safely confine the release leak from a tank in a facility catchment basin, wastewater treatment plant authorized to receive the tank contents and capable of containing and/or treating it in the event of a leak, or holding pond. Earthen dikes and similar containment structures must be designed and constructed to contain, for a minimum of 72 hours, fluid that escapes from a tank.(18) "Secretary" means the Secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection, or his or her designee.(19) "Source water protection area" for a public groundwater supply source is the area within an aquifer that supplies water to a public water supply well within a five-year time of travel and is determined by the mathematical calculation of the locations from which a drop of water placed at the edge of the protection area would theoretically take five years to reach the well.(20) "Zone of critical concern" for a public surface water supply source and for a public surface water influenced groundwater supply source is a corridor along streams within a watershed that warrants detailed scrutiny due to its proximity to the surface water intake and the intake’s susceptibility to potential contaminants within that corridor. The zone of critical concern is determined using a mathematical model that accounts for stream flows, gradient and area topography. The length of the zone of critical concern is based on a five-hour time of travel of water in the streams to the intake. The width of the zone of critical concern is 1,000 feet measured horizontally from each bank of the principal stream and 500 feet measured horizontally from each bank of the tributaries draining into the principal stream: Provided, That, any existing aboveground storage tank located in an area designated as a zone of critical concern on or after July 1, 2025, shall not become a level one regulated aboveground storage tank or be subject to the regulations related thereto for a period of nine months following written notice by certified mail or email sent to the owner or operator of such tanks in the newly-designated zone of critical concern.(21) "Zone of peripheral concern" for a public surface water supply source and for a public surface water influenced groundwater supply source is a corridor along streams within a watershed that warrants scrutiny due to its proximity to the surface water intake and the intake’s susceptibility to potential contaminants within that corridor. The zone of peripheral concern is determined using a mathematical model that accounts for stream flows, gradient, and area topography. The length of the zone of peripheral concern is based on an additional five-hour time of travel of water in the streams beyond the perimeter of the zone of critical concern, which creates a protection zone of 10 hours above the water intake. The width of the zone of peripheral concern is 1,000 feet measured horizontally from each bank of the principal stream and 500 feet measured horizontally from each bank of the tributaries draining into the principal stream: Provided, That, any existing aboveground storage tank located in an area designated as a zone of peripheral concern on or after July 1, 2025, shall not become a level two regulated aboveground storage tank or be subject to the regulations related thereto for a period of nine months following written notice, by certified mail or email sent to the owner or operator of such tanks in the newly-designated zone of peripheral concern.(22) "Leak" means any spilling, emitting, discharging, escaping or leaching of fluids from an aboveground storage tank into secondary containment. Upon the occurrence of a suspected or threatened leak, owners or operators of aboveground storage tanks must report the suspected or threatened leak to the secretary within 24 hours of discovery, unless the owner or operator is able to determine within that time period that the suspected or threatened leak was a false alarm.(23) "Temporarily out-of-service" (TOS) means an emptied aboveground storage tank in which the tank owner or operator has given notice to the Department through the registration process that fluids will not be deposited in the AST. While TOS, an AST is subject only to the registration requirements contained in 22-30-4 of this code, the notice requirements in 22-30-10 of this code, and the signage requirements in 22-30-11 of this code. TOS status ceases at the earlier of (A) closure of the AST, (B) notice of resumption of operational status by amending the registration to show the tank as currently in use; or (C) after five years in TOS status, at which time the owner or operator must return the tank to service or perform closure of the AST. Prior to returning a TOS tank to service an acceptable fit for service inspection performed by a qualified individual as defined in the AST rule shall be submitted to the Agency. §22-30-5. Aboveground Storage Tank Regulatory Program. (a) The secretary shall develop a regulatory program for new and existing regulated aboveground storage tanks and secondary containment that takes into account the size, location and contents of the tanks and sets out tiered requirements for regulated tanks. Level 1 tanks shall be regulated to a higher standard of tank and secondary containment integrity based upon their proximity to a public surface water supply source or public surface water influenced groundwater supply source.(b) The rules promulgated by the secretary for regulated tanks and secondary containment shall, at a minimum, include the following:(1) Criteria for the design, construction and maintenance of aboveground storage tanks; (2) Criteria for the design, construction, maintenance or methods of secondary containment;(3) Criteria for the design, operation, maintenance or methods of leak detection. Acceptable leak detection shall include, but not be limited to, visual inspections, an inventory control system together with tank testing, or a comparable system or method designed to identify leaks from aboveground storage tanks: Provided, That, in the absence of a known release, the secretary may not require inspection of secondary containment or tanks at a greater frequency than once per month; and Provided, however, That the secretary may not require any regulated tanks to be lifted, moved or otherwise physically altered in connection with a visual leak detection program in the absence of a confirmed release; and Provided further, That in addition, the secretary shall allow the use of remote non-destructive examination technologies in connection with any required periodic physical inspections of tanks in order to reduce, to the extent possible, human entry to confined spaces;(4) Requirements for recordkeeping;(5) Requirements for the development of maintenance and corrosion prevention plans;(6) Requirements for the closure of aboveground storage tanks, and any remediation necessary as a result of release from the aboveground storage tank; (7) The assessment of a registration fee, and annual operation and response fees as determined by the secretary;(8) Certificate to operate issuance only after the application and any other supporting documents have been submitted, reviewed and approved by the secretary;(9) A procedure for the administrative resolution of violations including the assessment of administrative civil penalties.(c) For those entities that are otherwise regulated under those provisions of this chapter that necessitate individual, site-specific permits or plans that require appropriate containment and diversionary structures or equipment to prevent discharged or released materials from reaching the waters of the state, the secretary may amend those permits or plans associated with those permits or both at the request of the permittee to include conditions pertaining to the management and control of regulated tanks, so long as those conditions in the opinion of the secretary are sufficient in combination with practices and protections already in place to protect the waters of the state. In its application for permit or plan modification, the permittee shall advise the secretary whether, how and to what extent the permittee adheres to other standards or plans with regard to tank and secondary containment integrity, inspection and spill prevention and response, including, without limitation, API 653 standards for Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration and Reconstruction or STI SP001 Standards for Aboveground Storage Tanks or the requirements of the federal spill prevention and countermeasures program governed by 40 C. F. R. Part 112. Inclusion of ASTs in amended permits or plans would not relieve the owner or operator's responsibility to pay registration, certificate to operate or Protect Our Water Fund fees. Specifically, the permits or plans the secretary may amend include:(1) Permits issued pursuant to the Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act, article three of this chapter;(2) Permits issued by the Office of Oil and Gas pursuant to article six or six-a of this chapter or spill pollution and control measures plans required under 35 C. S. R. 1;(3) Individual permits issued pursuant to the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System, article eleven of this chapter; (4) Permits issued pursuant to the Solid Waste Management Act, article fifteen of this chapter; and(5) Groundwater protection plans issued pursuant to article twelve of this chapter. (d) Any entity whose permit or plan modification or amendment relating to tank integrity and secondary containment design operation and maintenance is approved by the secretary and so maintained shall be deemed to be compliant with this article and entitles the entity to a certificate to operate so long as the registration requirements of section four of this article are also met.(e) The manner and time frames for implementation of the regulatory program required by this section shall be established by the secretary through the proposal of emergency or legislative rules in accordance with the provisions of §29A-3-1 et seq. of this code. §22-30-6. Evaluation and certification. (a) Each regulated aboveground storage tank and its associated secondary containment structure shall be evaluated by a qualified registered professional engineer or a qualified person working under the direct supervision of a registered professional engineer, regulated and licensed by the State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers, or by an individual certified to perform tank inspections by the American Petroleum Institute or the Steel Tank Institute, or by a person holding certification under another program approved by the secretary.(b) Every owner or operator shall submit a certification that each regulated tank and its associated secondary containment structure have been evaluated by a qualified person as set forth in subsection (a) of this section and meets the standards established in accordance with section five of this article.(c) The certification form shall be submitted to the secretary within 180 days of the effective date of the rules establishing standards that are adopted in accordance with section five of this article. Subsequent certifications shall be due at regular intervals thereafter as established by the secretary by legislative rule, but not more frequently than once per calendar year.(d) Any person who performs a tank evaluation in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, a responsible person designated by the owner or operator and any other person designated by the secretary by legislative rule may certify aboveground storage tanks in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.(e) Notwithstanding any subsection in this section, tanks identified under §22-30-3(1)(M) and (N) of this code that are located in a zone of critical concern are exempt from this section, but must be self-inspected and self-certified by its owner or operator at least once per year and reported to the agency; and tanks identified under §22-30-3(1)(M) and (N) of this code that are located in a zone of critical concern are required to have secondary containment inspections performed and documented by the owner or operator at least once per month. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to alter the definition of an aboveground storage tank.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
