These patterns are both symptoms of and added catalysts for students to become increasingly defeated and discouraged learners;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(D) By the middle grades, students with growing skill deficits usually know they are behind other students and have good reason to feel discouraged. A growing lack of self-confidence and self-worth, limited optimism for the future, avoidance of school and adults, and a dimming view of the relationship between effort and achievement are among the characteristics of defeated and discouraged learners;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(E) Public schools are expected to address the needs of all students, minimizing the likelihood that they will become at risk and giving additional attention to those who do; however, the circumstances involved with a becoming at risk often are complex and may include influences both within and outside of the school environment; and</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(F) In fragile homes, a child who is at risk and is becoming a discouraged and defeated learner often lacks adequate support and may develop peer relationships that further exacerbate the difficulty of reengaging him or her in learning, school, and responsible social behavior.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) The Legislature further finds that the public schools should not be deterred from seeking and assisting with enrollment of students in an alternative program that helps remedy the discouragement, lessens skill deficits, and facilitates a successful return to public school.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">&nbsp;(j) For this purpose, subject to approval of the county superintendent, a student enrolled in the public schools of the county may continue to be enrolled while also enrolled in an alternative program subject to the following conditions:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(1) The alternative program is approved by the state board;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) The student meets the general description of an at-risk student and exhibits behaviors and characteristics associated with a discouraged and defeated learner;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(3) The alternative program complies with all requests of the county superintendent for information on the educational program and progress of the student;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(4) The alternative program includes a family involvement component in its program.
