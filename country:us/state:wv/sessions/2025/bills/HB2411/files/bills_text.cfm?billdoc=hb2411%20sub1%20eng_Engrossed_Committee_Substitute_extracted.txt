The schools shall require regular courses of instruction by the completion of the 12th grade in the history of the United States, in civics, in the Constitution of the United States, and in the government of the State of West Virginia for the purpose of teaching, fostering, and perpetuating the ideals, principles, and spirit of political and economic democracy in America, and increasing the knowledge of the organization and machinery of the government of the United States and of the State of West Virginia. The required courses shall include instruction on the institutions and structure of American government, such as the separation of powers, the Electoral College, and federalism. The required courses shall include instruction that provides students an understanding of American political philosophy and history, utilizing writings from prominent figures in Western civilization, such as Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Thomas Jefferson. The courses of instruction shall offer an objective and critical analysis of ideologies throughout history including, but not limited to, capitalism, republicanism, democracy, socialism, communism, and fascism. The required courses shall emphasize the use of primary sources and interactive learning techniques, such as mock scenarios, debates, and open and impartial discussions. (2) The state board shall, with the advice of the state superintendent, and after consultation with other entities, prescribe the courses of study, including the basic course requirements for middle school and high school, and the academic standards listed in subdivision (1) of this subsection for these courses of study covering these subjects for the public schools, and publish an approved list of instructional resources pursuant to §18-2A-1 et seq. of this code. The curriculum used in the delivery of instruction shall cover the standards adopted for such courses. The other entities for consultation may include such organizations as the Florida Joint Center for Citizenship, the College Board, the Bill of Rights Institute, Hillsdale College, the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, the Constitutional Sources Project, educators, school administrators, postsecondary education representatives, elected officials, business and industry leaders, parents, and the public.  Officials or boards having authority over the respective private, parochial, and denominational schools shall prescribe courses of study for the schools under their control and supervision similar to those required for the public schools. (3) The state board shall provide testing or assessment instruments for the history and civics courses of instruction required by this section.

Nothing in this subsection creates a standard or requirement subject to state accountability measures.(f) Beginning the 2018-2019 school year, students in public schools shall be administered a test the same as or substantially similar to the civics portion of the naturalization test used by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services between their ninth and 12th grade years as an indicator of student achievement in the area of civics education. The test results may be reported in the aggregate to the county board for evaluation by the board's curriculum director and reported to the board members. Nothing in this subsection creates a standard or requirement subject to state accountability measures.(g) Beginning with the entering ninth grade class in the 2027-2028 school year, a public high school student shall be required to earn one unit of credit in a high school computer science course before the student graduates. "Computer science" means the study of computers, programming, and algorithms, including their principles, their hardware and software designs, their implementation, and their impact on society. Computer science does not include the study of everyday uses of computers and computer applications, such as keyboarding, word processing, digital literacy, or accessing the internet.(1) The one credit required in this subsection may be earned in grades eight through twelve.(2) A computer science course offered by a public high school shall:(A) Be of high quality; (B) Meet or exceed the curriculum standards established by the State Board of Education; and(C) Be made available in a traditional classroom setting. Only if a traditional classroom setting is not feasible shall a school offer the course in a blended learning environment or an online-based or other technology-based format that is tailored to meet the needs of each participating student: Provided, That the intent of (C) shall not interfere with the schedule of homeschool students or virtual students. (3) The one credit required in this subsection shall be allowed to substitute for one math credit or one personalized education plan credit.(4) The one credit shall be approved for one credit in Career Technical Education (CTE): Provided, That the credit shall be relevant to the program of study. (5) The state board shall adopt rules detailing how credit fulfillment under paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be granted. The rules shall ensure maximum flexibility for students. (6) Beginning in August of 2026, the State Board of Education shall make available to all public schools a list of course options that can meet the requirements for this credit. The state board shall update the list as often as necessary: Provided, That the state board shall create an approved list of courses that may be substituted. (7) The state board may adopt rules to administer this subsection, including rules for flexible options to license computer science teachers, which may include without limitation, approval codes, technical permits, ancillary licenses, and standard licenses. In adopting such rules, the board shall consider policy that ensures teacher subject area certification does not restrict the ability of students to earn a math or other substitution credit for a computer science course taken under this section.
