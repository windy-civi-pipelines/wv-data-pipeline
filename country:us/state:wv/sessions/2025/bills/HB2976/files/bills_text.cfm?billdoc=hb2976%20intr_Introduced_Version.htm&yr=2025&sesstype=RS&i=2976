The Auditor shall submit a report to the Joint Committee on Government and Finance not later than February 1, 2015, and provide details of the program operation including funds distributed and departments taking advantage of the subsidy.(i) To the best extent possible, the Auditor shall quantify and ensure fair workers' compensation rates and develop a more equitable method of tracking and billing for the various classifications within volunteer fire departments and emergency rescue personnel.
