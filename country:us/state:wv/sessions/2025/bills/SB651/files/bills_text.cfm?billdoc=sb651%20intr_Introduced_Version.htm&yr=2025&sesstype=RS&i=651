This presumption is conclusive for the purpose of establishing an entitlement to pain and suffering.(b) Once proof is provided to establish a miner's 15 years of exposure and presumptive requirement that the miner has occupational pneumoconiosis or black lung, the claimant is entitled to monetary benefits for pain and suffering alone.

A work year shall be calculated in terms of the number of hours a claimant worked during a calendar year. For this purpose, 1000 hours shall be considered a full work year. Any time less than 1000 hours in a calendar year shall be prorated when computing the award of the monthly benefit. §23-4D-4. Tax credit for benefits received under this article. Claimants receiving benefits under this article are entitled to claim those benefits as a credit against their state personal income tax.
