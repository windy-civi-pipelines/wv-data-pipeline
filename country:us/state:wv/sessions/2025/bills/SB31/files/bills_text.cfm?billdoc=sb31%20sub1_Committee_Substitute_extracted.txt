Red = new code to be enacted WEST virginia legislature2025 regular sessionCommittee SubstituteforSenate Bill 31By Senators Oliverio and Deeds[Reported February 26, 2025, from the Committee on the Judiciary] A BILL to amend and reenact §15-2B-2, §15-2B-3, §15-2B-5, §15-2B-6, §15-2B-9, and §15-2B-11 of the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, relating to DNA that is maintained for law-enforcement purposes in West Virginia; providing updates for the policy of maintaining DNA; defining terms; requiring DNA collection from all persons convicted of felonies and certain misdemeanors; requiring DNA collection from all persons charged by indictment or information of any felony offense after a grand jury has returned an indictment or prosecution by indictment has been waived; adding qualifying offense of domestic battery; specifying testing methods; authorizing emergency rules; requiring legislative rules; specifying expungement in certain circumstances; and providing failure to expunge or reasonably delay expungement will not invalidate an identification, warrant, probable cause to arrest, or arrest based upon a database match.  Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia: article 2B. DNA Data. §15-2B-2. Policy.(a) It is the policy of this state to assist federal, state, and local criminal justice and law-enforcement agencies in the identification, detection, and exclusion of individuals persons who are subjects of the investigation or prosecution of violent crimes, sex-related crimes, and other crimes against the person. DNA records are an important identification tool that can be used to confirm and verify information provided by fingerprints, and to identify additional information on potential criminal activity not available through other means. DNA technology further aids the criminal justice system inasmuch as it may assist persons mistakenly accused of crimes and exonerate persons wrongfully convicted of crimes. In furtherance of such that assistance, the Legislature finds:(1) That the analysis of DNA contained in biological evidence that may be recovered from a crime scene facilitates such the identification, detection, and exclusion;(2) That the comparison of DNA data recovered from a crime scene with existing DNA records maintained in a central DNA database further facilitates such the identification, detection, and exclusion; and(3) That requiring individuals persons who have been indicted by a grand jury for certain offenses, who have filed a waiver of indictment for certain offenses, and persons who have been convicted of a felony offense or other certain offenses to submit to convicted of certain crimes to provide a sample for DNA analysis with the resulting eligible DNA records maintained in a central DNA database will likewise further facilitate the aforementioned identification, detection, and exclusion and may serve to discourage recidivism.(b) Therefore, the Legislature finds that assisting federal, state, and local criminal justice and law-enforcement agencies through the use and development of DNA analysis is of the utmost importance and urgency in this state and that a DNA identification system shall be established as described in this article. §15-2B-3.
