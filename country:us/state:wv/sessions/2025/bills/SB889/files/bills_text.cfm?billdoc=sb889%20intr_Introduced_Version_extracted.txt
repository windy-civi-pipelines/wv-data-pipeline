The sponsoring public charter school shall not unreasonably withhold approval, and all personnel decisions for the rural in-person public charter school shall conform to the same standards or criteria applied by the sponsoring public charter school to personnel in similar positions within its own operations. The permanent governing board shall document its personnel decisions and submit them to the sponsoring public charter school for review and approval in a manner specified in the support agreement under subsection (e).(8) The state board shall promulgate rules pursuant to §29A-3B-1 et seq. of this code to provide guidance on the establishment and operation of rural in-person public charter school governing boards, including procedures for the transition from the ad hoc committee to the permanent governing board, the selection of permanent board members, the management of property owned by the rural in-person public charter school, and a process by which a rural in-person public charter school may change its sponsoring public charter school if the support relationship becomes untenable. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to create the Sustaining Opportunities for Academics in Rural ("SOAR") Schools Act.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.

The West Virginia Professional Charter School Board shall monitor compliance and may withhold the supplemental funding of $2,500 per student from any sponsoring public charter school that fails to maintain the separate account, disburse the per-pupil funding as required by this subsection, or use such funding for purposes other than those specified.(h) The state board shall promulgate rules pursuant to §29A-3B-1 et seq. of this code that address:(1) Implementation of this section;(2) Administration of the funds required to be distributed to sponsoring public charter schools for the benefit of rural in-person public charter schools;(3) Monitoring compliance with this section and the rules required by this subsection; and(4) Ensuring the effective operation of the rural in-person public charter schools.(i) Governance of rural in-person public charter schools.(1) Each rural in-person public charter school established under this section shall have a separate governing board, distinct from the governing board of the sponsoring public charter school, responsible for its management, operation, and accountability. The establishment of the rural in-person public charter school shall proceed in two stages: an initial ad hoc committee followed by a permanent governing board.(2) The initial governance of the rural in-person public charter school shall be undertaken by an ad hoc committee formed by individuals seeking to establish the school. This committee shall: (A) Negotiate with one or more potential sponsoring public charter schools to develop the support agreement under subsection (e) and secure sponsorship for the rural in-person public charter school; (B) Submit the proposed charter contract, including the support agreement, to the authorizer of the selected sponsoring public charter school (county board or West Virginia Professional Charter School Board) for approval pursuant to §18-5G-8 of this code; (C) Not be required to meet the composition criteria for the permanent governing board specified in subdivision (3) of this subsection, but its members may not be employees of any potential sponsoring public charter school.(3) Upon approval of the charter contract and within 90 days of the rural in-person public charter school’s opening, the ad hoc committee shall transition to a permanent governing board consisting of five members, constituted as follows: (A) At least two members shall be parents of students enrolled in the rural in-person public charter school; (B) At least one member shall be a resident of the community served by the rural in-person public charter school, who may or may not be a parent of an enrolled student; (C) Two additional members, who may or may not meet the criteria in paragraphs (A) or (B), provided that no member of the governing board may be an employee of the rural in-person public charter school or the sponsoring public charter school; (D) If a county board designates an official attendance area for the rural in-person public charter school pursuant to subsection (f), the county superintendent of schools or their designee shall be entitled to one of the five seats on the governing board, replacing one of the members under paragraph (C). In such case, the initial board shall consist of four members until the superintendent or designee is appointed.(4) The ad hoc committee, in collaboration with the selected sponsoring public charter school, shall propose the initial members of the permanent governing board and the selection process as part of the support agreement under subsection (e), subject to approval by the authorizer. The selection process may include appointment by the ad hoc committee, election by parents or community members in the rural area served, or a combination thereof. Subsequent vacancies on the permanent governing board shall be filled according to the process established in the support agreement.(5) The permanent governing board shall assume responsibility for the charter contract with the authorizer, consistent with §18-5G-6 of this code, specifying its duties and the terms of operation for the rural in-person public charter school. All real and personal property acquired for or by the rural in-person public charter school, including but not limited to facilities, equipment, and supplies, shall be the property of the rural in-person public charter school and managed by its permanent governing board, notwithstanding the support relationship with the sponsoring public charter school. Property acquired during the ad hoc committee phase shall transfer to the rural in-person public charter school upon its establishment.(6) The permanent governing board shall comply with all applicable provisions of §18-5G-6 of this code, including public accountability requirements, and shall coordinate with the sponsoring public charter school to ensure the effective delivery of services under subsection (e). The rural in-person public charter school’s permanent governing board may propose a change in its sponsoring public charter school pursuant to rules promulgated by the state board under subdivision (8) of this subsection. During the transition phase of changing a sponsoring public charter school, the permanent governing board shall designate whether the current or proposed future sponsoring public charter school shall represent the rural in-person public charter school before the West Virginia Professional Charter School Board, as provided in subsection (e)(1). (7) The permanent governing board of the rural in-person public charter school shall have the authority to make personnel decisions, including but not limited to hiring, evaluation, promotion, and termination of teachers, administrators, and other staff employed by the rural in-person public charter school: Provided, That all such personnel decisions shall be subject to approval by the governing board of the sponsoring public charter school. The sponsoring public charter school shall not unreasonably withhold approval, and all personnel decisions for the rural in-person public charter school shall conform to the same standards or criteria applied by the sponsoring public charter school to personnel in similar positions within its own operations. The permanent governing board shall document its personnel decisions and submit them to the sponsoring public charter school for review and approval in a manner specified in the support agreement under subsection (e).(8) The state board shall promulgate rules pursuant to §29A-3B-1 et seq. of this code to provide guidance on the establishment and operation of rural in-person public charter school governing boards, including procedures for the transition from the ad hoc committee to the permanent governing board, the selection of permanent board members, the management of property owned by the rural in-person public charter school, and a process by which a rural in-person public charter school may change its sponsoring public charter school if the support relationship becomes untenable. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to create the Sustaining Opportunities for Academics in Rural ("SOAR") Schools Act.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
