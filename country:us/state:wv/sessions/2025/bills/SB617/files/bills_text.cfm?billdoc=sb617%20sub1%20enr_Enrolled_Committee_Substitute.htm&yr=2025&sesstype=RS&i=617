Red = new code to be enacted WEST virginia legislature2025 regular sessionEnrolledCommittee SubstituteforSenate Bill 617By Senators Roberts, Azinger, Barrett, Deeds, Fuller, Hart, Helton, Jeffries, Maynard, Morris, Rose, Stuart, Tarr, Thorne, Bartlett, and Willis[Passed April 10, 2025; in effect 90 days from passage (July 9, 2025)]   AN ACT to amend and reenact §61-13-1, §61-13-2, and §61-13-3 of the Code of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, relating to organized criminal enterprises; amending the findings to include gangs and gang activity; creating a definition of “gang”; adding gang activity to offenses punishable by this section; adding certain qualifying offenses to be subject to the Anti-Organized Criminal Enterprise Act; clarifying that certain offenses are separate and distinct crimes; creating criminal penalties; and making technical corrections. Be it enacted by the Legislature of West Virginia: Article 13. Anti-Organized Criminal Enterprise Act. §61-13-1. Findings. (a) The Legislature hereby finds that there is evidence of an increasing incidence of larger scale organized criminal activity and gang activity in various parts of this state and that new statutes are necessary to protect the lives and property of the overwhelming majority of West Virginians who are law-abiding citizens. The evidence presented to the Legislature reflects that persons engaged in larger scale ongoing criminal or gang enterprises are of all ages, multiple racial and ethnic origin, and all pose a rising threat.(b) The Legislature further finds that there is a tendency among certain of these enterprises to actively recruit, sometimes coercively, people into joining such organizations as well as organized efforts to intimidate witnesses who may be in a position to offer testimony regarding the organized criminal enterprises and that such behavior cannot be tolerated.(c) The Legislature further finds that lawful use of public nuisance and forfeiture laws can substantially aid in a reduction of larger scale organized criminal enterprises.(d) The Legislature further finds that criminal statutes tailored to the particular problems represented by such organized criminal enterprises combined with community education and existing alternative sentencing laws can aid in reducing this new threat. §61-13-2. Definitions. As used in this article: “Gang” means any ongoing organization, association, or group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal, having as one of its activities the commission of one or more qualifying offenses, and whose members engage in or have engaged in qualifying offenses.
