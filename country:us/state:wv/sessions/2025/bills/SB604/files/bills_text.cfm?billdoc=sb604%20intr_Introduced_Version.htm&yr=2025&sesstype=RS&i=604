The special reduced rate offered by each gas and electric utility to its eligible customers shall be 20 percent less than the rate which would be applicable to such customers if they were not receiving any of the four forms of assistance which confer eligibility for the special reduced rates. A customer of a utility offering special reduced rates shall be eligible to receive such rates for each of the billing months of December, January, February, March and April that correlates to a calendar month during which that customer is eligible to participate in one or more of the qualifying programs specified in this section, except as otherwise provided in this section.

Before any individual may qualify to receive the special reduced rates, the following requirements must be met:(a) The special reduced rates shall apply only to current customers or to those persons who subsequently become customers in their own right. If an SSI, AFDC, AFDC- U or food stamp recipient is living in a household which is served under the name of a person who is not an SSI, AFDC, AFDC-U or food stamp recipient, that service may not be changed or have been changed subsequent to March 12, 1983 2025, to the name of the SSI, AFDC, AFDC-U or food stamp recipient in order to qualify for service under the special reduced rates.(b) The burden of proving eligibility for the special reduced rates shall be on the customer requesting such rates. The department of human services Department of Human Services shall establish by rules and regulations procedures (1) to inform persons receiving any of the four forms of assistance which confer eligibility for the special reduced rates about the availability of the special reduced rates, (2) to assist applicants persons who are eligible for the special reduced rates in proving their eligibility therefor, (3) To notify the commission of a person's eligibility for the special reduced rates; and (3) (4) to assist gas and electric utilities offering the special reduced rates in determining on a continuing basis the eligibility therefor of persons receiving or applying for such rates.

Each such credit shall be fully reflected on the first bill issued to each such customer after approval of each such customer's application the commission has notified the utility that a customer is eligible for the special reduced rates, except in cases where the interval between the approval and the issuance of the next bill is so short that it is administratively impracticable to do so, in which cases such credits shall be fully reflected on the second next bill issued to each such customer after approval of that customer's application.

Each credit shall be fully reflected on the first bill issued to each customer after approval of each customer’s application the commission has notified the utility that a customer is eligible for the special reduced rates, except in cases where the interval between the approval and the issuance of the next bill is so short that it is administratively impracticable to do so, in which case, such credits shall be fully reflected on the second next bill issued to each customer after approval of that customer’s application. If the interval between the approval and the issuance of the next bill is 15 days or more, it may not be deemed administratively impracticable to reflect the credit on the customer’s first bill. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to require the Department of Human Services to notify the Public Service Commission that a utility customer is eligible for discounts on their utility bills and to require the Commission to order that the utility apply the discount without requiring the customer to apply for it.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
