If the person is otherwise required to participate in the Alcohol and Drug Test and Lock Program for another offense, he or she may do so while meeting the conditions described in this subsection. If the person fails to submit to a drug test or submits to a test that reveals the presence of controlled substances or drugs, then the full revocation period is reinstated, and the person is only credited with revocation time actually served prior to receiving restricted privileges.
