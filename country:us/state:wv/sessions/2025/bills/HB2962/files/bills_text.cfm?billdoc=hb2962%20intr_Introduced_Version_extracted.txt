If either of the parents is a minor, the statement shall include an explanation of any rights that may be afforded due to the minority status.(2) The failure or refusal to include all information required by subdivision (1) of this subsection does not affect the validity of the affidavit of paternity, in the absence of a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that it was obtained by fraud, duress or material mistake of fact, as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection.(3) The original notarized affidavit of paternity shall be filed with the state Registrar.
