Prior to the conclusion of the program, the Department Division, in coordination with Marshall University, shall report to the Legislature’s Joint Commission on Economic Development on the following:(1) Progress towards and methods of implementation of the pilot program, including the required certifications and training for small business enterprises;(2) An analysis of the overall program results based on the metrics created in the master plan of the pilot program;(3) Recommendations as to whether the pilot program should continue beyond its current duration; and(4) Any proposed plan or legislation necessary to accomplish the purpose of making the program permanent.  (e) For purposes of the pilot program, any information provided by a small business enterprise for purposes of the certification process shall be considered private and confidential and exempt from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, as provided in §29B-1-1, et seq. of this code.  Neither the Department nor Marshall University may share any information provided by a small business enterprise with any other state or federal agencies unless required by law. §5B-2-19.
