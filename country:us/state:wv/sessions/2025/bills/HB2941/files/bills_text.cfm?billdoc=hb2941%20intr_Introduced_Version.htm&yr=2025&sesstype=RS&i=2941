(c) Notwithstanding §30-27A-14 of this code, the commission may deny a state’s participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of §30-27A-12 of this code, terminate a member state’s participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters. §30-27A-15. Consistent effect and conflict with other state laws.
