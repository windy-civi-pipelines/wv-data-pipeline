Prohibition on state procurement of electric vehicles with forced labor components. (a) Legislative Findings. – The state of West Virginia finds that:(1) Many electric vehicles are being made with components created through the use of forced labor, including by Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the Peoples Republic of China's Xingijang region;(2) Concerns about the use of forced labor to create these components and materials prompted the federal government to pass the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) with overwhelming bipartisan support;(3) Under the UFLPA, there is a rebuttable presumption that any product manufactured in whole or in part in the Xingjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was produced by forced labor;(4) The federal government recently restricted the application of its newly created tax credits for electric vehicles, so that "[b]eginning in 2024, an eligible vehicle may not contain any battery components that are manufactured by a foreign entity of concern and beginning in 2025 an eligible clean vehicle may not contain any critical minerals that were extracted, processed, or recycled by a foreign entity of concern";(5) The federal government recently proposed a regulation for another act that any company subject to the Peoples Republic of China's jurisdiction will be defined as a "foreign entity of concern", which would prevent federal tax credits from supporting sales of electric vehicles made with battery components from Chinese entities;(6) In addition, many vehicles also are being made with components created through the use of oppressive child labor, most notably, through cobalt ore mined in dangerous conditions by thousands of young children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and sent to the Peoples Republic of China for use in manufacturing lithium-ion batteries;(7) The federal government recently concluded that "downstream products containing lithium-ion batteries may be produced with an input produced with child labor, such as electric cars;"(8) The use of forced labor is repugnant and deplorable, violates basic human rights, constitutes unacceptable discrimination, and damages free and fair competition; and(9) State governments should take steps to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not being used to pay for electric vehicles that may have been partially manufactured through forced labor.(b) Definitions. – (1) "Forced labor" means all work or service that is (A) obtained by force, fraud, or coercion, including by threat of serious harm to, or physical restraint against, any person;
