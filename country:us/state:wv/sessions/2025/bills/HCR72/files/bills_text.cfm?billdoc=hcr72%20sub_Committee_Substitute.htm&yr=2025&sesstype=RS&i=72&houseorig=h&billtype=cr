It's an occupational lung disease that's most common in coal miners. Over time, coal dust particles inflame and scar the lungs, making the essential function of breathing difficult; andWhereas, There is no way to reverse black lung disease and it is a lifelong condition, shortening the life expectancy of those with the disease by an average of 12.6 years; andWhereas, Coal miners who develop complicated black lung disease require medical care, regular lung function testing, X-rays, pulmonary rehabilitation, and often require supplemental oxygen to breathe and suffer with this disability. In the most severe cases, lung transplants may be necessary; andWhereas, Black lung disease is preventable, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration has a set of safety standards to help workers avoid the disease. Under these guidelines, all coal miners should wear a mask, wash any skin that comes in contact with dust, safely remove dust from all clothing and wash their face and hands before eating, drinking or taking medication. In addition, all mines are regulated to limit how much coal dust is in the air; andWhereas, Black lung disease is a progressive disease that often leaves miners unaware of its presence until they are retiring from the mines; andWhereas, The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 stated that "[t]he first priority and concern of all in the mining industry must be the health and safety of our most precious resource, the miner;" andWhereas, Those who contract black lung disease while honorably working a dangerous job to support their families are entitled to monthly payments under the Black Lung Benefits Act, as are their survivors to help offset this deadly and costly disease; therefore, be itResolved by the Legislature of West Virginia:That to honor those upon whom we rely for the electricity we use and the advancements we are able to make, and to protect them and their families from the debilitating effects of this preventable disease, we recognize March as "Black Lung Awareness Month."
