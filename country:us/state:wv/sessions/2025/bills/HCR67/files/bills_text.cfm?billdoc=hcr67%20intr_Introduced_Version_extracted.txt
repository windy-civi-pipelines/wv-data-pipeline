Howell, Jeffries, Leavitt, Lewis, Pushkin, and Shamblin)[February 25, 2025; Referredto the committee on Energy and Public Worksthen Rules ] Requesting the Division of Highways name a planned bridge in Kanawha County, beginning at Latitude 38.355694, Longitude -81.713474, carrying Jefferson Road, County Route 601, over Kanawha Boulevard and Davis Creek, ending at Latitude 38.353792, Longitude -81.711736, the "U. S. Army 2LT Darwin Keith 'Gus' Kyle Memorial Bridge—a Medal of Honor Recipient".Whereas, Darwin Keith "Gus" Kyle was born on June 1, 1921, in Jenkins, Letcher County, Kentucky, and was raised in West Virginia; andWhereas, Gus enlisted as an infantryman in the U.S. Army just weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor; andWhereas, Gus served in Europe during World War II and was awarded a Bronze Star and Silver Star for heroic actions in France and Germany; andWhereas, Gus survived World War II and returned to his home in South Charleston, West Virginia; andWhereas, Gus was once again called upon to serve his country when North Koreans attacked across the 38th Parallel. Gus was deployed to South Korea with the 7th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. Gus was promoted to Master Sergeant following numerous enemy engagements; andWhereas, Gus was stationed at the Port of Hungnam on North Korea's east coast, where he participated in the Hungnam Evacuation, protecting the port from a Chinese invasion for nearly two weeks while military units and refugees were being evacuated; andWhereas, On Christmas Eve, December 24, 1950, as the last Americans were leaving Hungnam, a huge explosion from a nearby ammunition dump ripped through the beach. With the waterfront engulfed in flames and shrapnel ripping into soldiers trying to escape the inferno, Gus began pulling wounded and dying men from the raging fires and ensuing smaller explosions. Jumping into a landing craft filled with soldiers, Gus maneuvered the boat away from the beach just seconds before another violent explosion occurred. According to eyewitness accounts, Gus's actions saved the lives of the men trapped in the vessel. Gus was awarded the Soldier's Medal and given a battlefield commission to 2LT for his heroic actions; andWhereas, Just weeks after receiving his battlefield promotion, on February 15, 1951, Gus was leading his men up a snow-packed, wind-swept hill near Suwon, South Korea, when his platoon came under machine-gun and mortar fire. In total disregard for his own safety, Gus charged into a Chinese gun position and single-handedly killed seven Chinese soldiers, four in hand-to-hand combat, before being mowed down by enemy fire. One of Gus's men, Sergeant James Yeomans, attributed Gus's actions to saving the unit and described Gus as "the bravest man he ever saw"; andWhereas, Gus was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for "his extraordinary heroism and outstanding leadership…and his gallant self-sacrifice [which] reflect the highest credit upon himself and are in keeping with the esteemed traditions of the military service"; andWhereas, A South Charleston elementary school was named in Gus's honor in 1955, but the school closed in 1973; andWhereas, On February 4, 2021, the City of South Charleston passed a resolution to recognize Gus and to petition the West Virginia Legislature to name the new Jefferson Road Bridge in his honor; andWhereas, It is fitting that an enduring memorial be established to commemorate U.S. Army 2LT Darwin Keith "Gus" Kyle and his contributions to our state and country; therefore, be it Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia:That the Division of Highways is hereby requested to name a planned bridge in Kanawha County, beginning at Latitude 38.355694, Longitude -81.713474, carrying Jefferson Road, County Route 601, over Kanawha Boulevard and Davis Creek, ending at Latitude 38.353792, Longitude -81.711736, the "U.

S. Army 2LT Darwin Keith "Gus" Kyle Memorial Bridge—A Medal of Honor Recipient"; and, be itFurther Resolved, That the Clerk of the House is hereby directed to forward a copy of this resolution to the Commissioner of the Division of Highways.
