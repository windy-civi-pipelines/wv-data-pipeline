Upon the occurrence of an injury which the employee asserts, or which reasonably appears to have, occurred in the course of and resulting from the employee&#39;s employment, the employer may require the employee to undergo a blood test for the purpose of determining the existence or nonexistence of evidence of intoxication: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided</span><span class="csE736517A">, That the employer must have a reasonable and good faith objective suspicion of the employee&#39;s intoxication and may only test for the purpose of determining whether the person is intoxicated. If any blood test for intoxication is given following an accident, at the request of the employer or otherwise, and if any of the following are true, the employee is deemed intoxicated and the intoxication is the proximate cause of the injury:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(1) If a blood test is administered within two hours of the accident and evidence that there was, at that time, more than five hundredths of one percent, by weight, of alcohol in the employee&#39;s blood; or</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) If there was, at the time of the blood test, evidence of either on or off the job use of a nonprescribed controlled substance as defined in the West Virginia Uniform Controlled Substances Act, West Virginia Code &sect;60A-2-201, </span><span class="cs50A3B802">et seq</span><span class="csE736517A">., Schedules I, II, III, IV and V.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(b) For the purpose of this chapter, the commission may cooperate with the Office of Miners&#39; Health, Safety and Training and the State Division of Labor in promoting general safety programs and in formulating rules to govern hazardous employments.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(c) If injury results to any employee from the deliberate intention of his or her employer to produce the injury or death, the employee, or, if the employee has been found to be incompetent, his or her conservator or guardian, may recover under this chapter and bring a cause of action against the employer, as if this chapter had not been enacted, for any excess of damages over the amount received or receivable in a claim for benefits under this chapter. If death results to any employee from the deliberate intention of his or her employer to produce the injury or death, the representative of the estate may recover under this chapter and bring a cause of action, pursuant to section six, article seven of chapter fifty-five of this code, against the employer, as if this chapter had not been enacted, for any excess of damages over the amount received or receivable in a claim for benefits under this chapter. To recover under this section, the employee, the employee&#39;s representative or dependent, as defined under this chapter, must, unless good cause is shown, have filed a claim for benefits under this chapter.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(d)(1) It is declared that enactment of this chapter and the establishment of the workers&#39; compensation system in this chapter was and is intended to remove from the common law tort system all disputes between or among employers and employees regarding the compensation to be received for injury or death to an employee except as expressly provided in this chapter and to establish a system which compensates even though the injury or death of an employee may be caused by his or her own fault or the fault of a co-employee; that the immunity established in sections six and six-a, article two of this chapter is an essential aspect of this workers&#39; compensation system; that the intent of the Legislature in providing immunity from common lawsuit was and is to protect those immunized from litigation outside the workers&#39; compensation system except as expressly provided in this chapter; that, in enacting the immunity provisions of this chapter, the Legislature intended to create a legislative standard for loss of that immunity of more narrow application and containing more specific mandatory elements than the common law tort system concept and standard of willful, wanton and reckless misconduct; and that it was and is the legislative intent to promote prompt judicial resolution of the question of whether a suit prosecuted under the asserted authority of this section is or is not prohibited by the immunity granted under this chapter.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) The immunity from suit provided under this section and under sections six and six-a, article two of this chapter may be lost only if the employer or person against whom liability is asserted acted with &quot;deliberate intention&quot;. This requirement may be satisfied only if:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(A) It is proved that the employer or person against whom liability is asserted acted with a consciously, subjectively and deliberately formed intention to produce the specific result of injury or death to an employee. This standard requires a showing of an actual, specific intent and may not be satisfied by allegation or proof of: (i) Conduct which produces a result that was not specifically intended; (ii) conduct which constitutes negligence, no matter how gross or aggravated;
