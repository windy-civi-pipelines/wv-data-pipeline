Red = new code to be enacted SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 1(By Senator Martin)[Introduced January 8, 2025] Adopting joint rules of the Senate and House of Delegates.Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia:That the joint rules of the Senate and House of Delegates be adopted as follows and shall govern the proceedings of the eighty-seventh Legislature, subject to amendment as provided in the standing rules of the Senate and the House of Delegates:Joint Assembly1. Whenever there shall be a joint assembly of the two houses, a brief account of the proceedings shall be entered upon the Journal of each house, except in the joint assembly for counting votes for state officers.Joint Assembly to Open and Publish Election Returns2. As soon as the Senate, being organized, is informed that the House of Delegates is ready to proceed, as provided by Article VII, Section 3 of the Constitution of West Virginia, to open and publish the returns of the election for state officers, the Senate, preceded by its presiding officer and other officers, shall repair in a body to the hall of the House of Delegates. Upon their arrival the Sergeant at Arms of the House of Delegates shall announce the presence of the Senate. The presiding officer of the Senate shall then address the Speaker of the House, stating that a majority of the Senate has assembled in the hall of the House of Delegates to be present at the opening and publishing of the returns of the elections for State officers, held on the ______ day of _____________. The Speaker of the House of Delegates shall invite the presiding officer of the Senate to a seat upon his right, and the other members of the Senate and officers thereof to take seats assigned to them, and after announcing that a majority of the House of Delegates is present, shall then open and publish the returns of said election, proceeding by counties in alphabetical order, the Clerks of the two houses each taking down the returns as announced by the Speaker, to be entered upon the Journal of the House, and when completed and tabulated the Speaker shall announce the votes received by each person voted for, for each of said offices, and those receiving the largest number of votes, shall be by him declared duly elected; and the Senate shall then return to its hall, and if any two or more candidates for any of said offices have an equal and the highest number of votes for the same office, the two houses shall immediately proceed to choose one of such persons for said office by a joint vote, as provided by Article VII, Section 3 of the Constitution of West Virginia.Disagreement and Conference3. (a) Whenever a measure of one house is amended in the other and the house in which it originated shall refuse to concur in the amendment, the house amending the measure may either insist or recede therefrom. But when a measure originating in one house is amended in the other, the house in which it originated may amend such amendment and a motion therefor shall take precedence of a motion to concur. If said house refuses to concur, the other house may either recede from or insist upon its amendment, and a motion to recede shall take precedence of a motion to insist. The motion to lay on the table or to postpone indefinitely shall not be in order in respect to the motion to recede from or to insist. A motion to recede having failed shall be equivalent to the adoption of a motion to insist and shall be so entered upon the Journal. A motion to insist being decided in the negative shall be equivalent to the adoption of a motion to recede and shall be so entered upon the Journal. If the motion to insist prevails, the house so insisting shall request a committee of conference on the subject of disagreement and shall appoint a committee therefor. The other house may thereupon appoint such committee. Unless a different number is agreed upon, such conference committee shall consist of three members from each house. Such committee shall consider and report upon only the subject matter of the amendment or amendments which were in disagreement, with necessary consequential changes. The committee shall meet at a convenient time, to be agreed upon by their Chairs, and upon notifying all conferees of the time and place of any such meeting, and having conferred freely, shall report to their respective houses the result of the conference. In case of agreement, the report shall be first made, with the papers referred accompanying it, to the house of origin, and there acted upon; and such action, with the papers referred, shall be immediately reported by the Clerk to the other house. In case of disagreement, the papers shall remain with the house in which the measure originated. If an agreement is reached, the report shall be made and signed in duplicate by at least a majority of the conferees from each house, one of the duplicates being retained by the conferees of each house. (b) Any conference report shall, upon recognition by the presiding officer, be communicated to each house by its Clerk and made available to members of each house. Each house shall designate a location or office where copies of such report shall be made available. The Clerk shall communicate availability of conference reports by an announcement to the members of said house during session. Such announcement can be made at any time upon recognition by the presiding officer, and the Clerk shall duly note the time of said announcement. Except as provided herein, the conference report shall lie over one day and shall not be considered in either house until at least the next day following, but thereafter it shall be proper to take up consideration of the conference report at any time otherwise permitted by the rules of such house whether or not such house met on the preceding day: Provided, That after the fifty-ninth day of any regular session or on any day of any extraordinary session a conference committee report may be considered the same day if availability of written copies of such report is communicated to that house while in session at least two hours prior to any consideration: Provided, however, That the conference report may be taken up for immediate consideration at any time by a two-thirds vote of the members of that house present.With respect to any conference agreed to within the first fifty-one days of a regular session, the conference committee shall report to each house within seven days of agreement to conference or be discharged, except that upon a concurrent resolution duly adopted by a majority of those present and voting in each house, the presiding officer of each house may extend the conference not to exceed an additional three days. In no event shall a conference committee report to each house later than 8:00 P.M. on the sixtieth day. With respect to any conference agreed to after the fifty-first day of a regular session, or any time during any extraordinary session, the conference committee shall report to each house within three days after agreement to conference or be discharged, except that such conference may be extended by concurrent resolution duly adopted by a majority of those present and voting in each house, for a period not to exceed one additional day. In no event shall a conference committee report to each house later than 8:00 P.M. on the sixtieth day. Any conference committee which fails to report within the time limits established by this rule shall be deemed to be discharged, and the papers referred shall remain with the house in which the measure originated. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the presiding officer of either house to appoint or discharge any conference committee as heretofore provided, such right to appoint and discharge such committee being subject to the rules of each respective house. The provisions of subsection (b) above shall not apply to the Budget Bill. Messages Between the Houses4. When a message is sent by one house to the other, it shall be communicated by the Clerk thereof to the Clerk of the house to which it is sent, but no message shall be received during a call of the roll. The Clerk of one house may communicate a message to the Clerk of the other at any time.Bill Processing5. (a) Legislation recommended by the Governor or by executive departments or agencies is requested to be filed in the respective Clerks' offices, and a copy sent to Legislative Services, no later than the tenth day of each regular session of a Legislature. (b) No bill or joint resolution shall be considered on third reading in its house of origin after the fiftieth day, unless authorization shall be granted by a concurrent resolution adopted by a two-thirds vote of the members present of both houses: Provided, That the Budget Bill, or any salary or supplementary appropriation bills, may be considered at any time. (c) This rule may be suspended by adopting a concurrent resolution approved by a two-thirds majority of those present and voting in each house. A house desiring to suspend this rule may adopt a concurrent resolution and proceed as if the concurrent resolution had been adopted in both houses and the rule suspended. Any bill or joint resolution passed pursuant to such concurrent resolution may be communicated to the other house with the concurrent resolution or at any time after the concurrent resolution has been communicated to the other house. The other house may proceed to consider such bill or joint resolution only after adopting the concurrent resolution. The provisions of this rule shall not apply to any extended regular session or to any extraordinary session.Processing of Bills Authorizing the Promulgation of Proposed Legislative Rules; Duplication and Distribution of Proposed Legislative Rules.5a. A "bill authorizing the promulgation of proposed legislative rules" or a "bill of authorization" is a measure intended to be enacted as general law, which incorporates by reference a proposed legislative rule, with or without amendments or substitutions set forth in the bill, and which authorizes the promulgation and implementation of the proposed legislative rule. The processing of bills authorizing the promulgation of proposed legislative rules shall be governed by the standing rules of the Senate and the House of Delegates, which are supplemented by the provisions of this joint rule. In the case of any conflict between this rule and a standing rule of the Senate or the House of Delegates, the provisions of this rule shall control. (1) The requirement of either house that bills shall be presented in duplicate applies to bills authorizing the promulgation of proposed legislative rules, but does not apply to the proposed legislative rule which the bill incorporates by reference. Of the duplicate copies, only the designated original copy shall have appended thereto the full text of the proposed legislative rule as finally approved by the agency seeking permission for its promulgation. Other copies of the full text of the proposed legislative rule shall be made available to members of the Legislature as hereinafter provided. (2) Copies of the full text of each proposed legislative rule shall be reproduced by printing or duplication by the Clerk prior to, or as soon as is reasonably practicable after, the introduction of the bill which would authorize by law the promulgation of the proposed legislative rule. Prior to such printing or duplication, a notation shall be affixed to the proposed legislative rule which identifies the bill number of the introduced bill which would authorize its promulgation and which also identifies the committee or committees of the house to which the bill is to be referred by the presiding officer following its introduction. Otherwise, the copies printed or duplicated shall conform to the copy of the proposed legislative rule appended to the original bill, so as to facilitate the consideration and amendment of the rule throughout the legislative process. (3) The Clerk shall furnish to any member, upon his or her request, without cost, one copy of the full text of a proposed legislative rule as reproduced by the Clerk in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2) of this Joint Rule. For any request for an additional copy or copies of the proposed legislative rule, the member requesting the copy or copies shall pay to the Clerk, in advance, a charge which the Clerk has reasonably determined to be adequate to cover the actual cost of the printing or duplication: Provided, That the provisions herein for the Clerk to furnish a member with an additional copy or copies, with a cost charged, may not interfere with or delay the prompt and otherwise timely consideration of bills of authorization by the house or its committees or subcommittees. (4) Whenever the standing rules of either house require the printing or reprinting of a bill, the rules apply to bills authorizing the promulgation of a proposed legislative rule with the same force and effect as they apply to other bills. However, no printing or reprinting of the proposed legislative rule which is incorporated by reference in the bill of authorization shall be required, other than the printing required by subsection (2) of this Joint Rule. (5) Whenever the standing rules of either house require a bill to be read, or fully and distinctly read, the rules apply to bills authorizing the promulgation of a proposed legislative rule with the same force and effect as they apply to other bills. However, no reading of the proposed legislative rule which is incorporated by reference in the bill of authorization shall be required. One House to Notify Other of Rejection of Bill6. When a bill or resolution passed in one house is rejected in the other, notice thereof shall be sent to the house in which the same shall have been passed. Record of Bills and Resolutions7. The Clerks of the two houses shall keep separate records or registers, in which shall be recorded every action taken by the Senate and House on each bill and resolution.

(b) The committee shall consist of seven members of the Senate to be appointed by the presiding officer of the Senate and seven members of the House of Delegates to be appointed by the presiding officer of the House of Delegates. If possible, no more than five of the seven members appointed by the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Delegates, respectively, may be members of the same political party.

When the members meet separately, they may function as other committees of that house. As far as practicable, relevant information, including actuarial letters or notes, gathered by members meeting separately from the other house shall be sent to the cochair of the other house if it is considering the same or similar legislation.12.

After the text has been so corrected, not less than five copies of the bill shall be printed. One of the copies, when properly authenticated, shall become the Enrolled Bill. In the case of enrolled bills authorizing the promulgation of a proposed legislative rule, a copy of the full text of the proposed legislative rule which the bill incorporates by reference shall be appended to the bill which has been properly authenticated and designated to be the Enrolled Bill. The copy appended to the Enrolled Bill shall conform to the copy of the full text of the proposed legislative rule appended to the introduced bill.

Following action by the Governor, or the failure or refusal of the Governor to approve or disapprove a bill of authorization, the copy of the Enrolled Bill with the proposed legislative rule appended is the copy of the bill filed with the Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of Rule 19 of these Joint Rules.Authentication of Enrolled Bills16. Enrolled Bills shall be authenticated by the signature of the Clerk of each house, whose duty it shall be to compare carefully all bills and joint resolutions passed by both houses, with the enrollment thereof, and to correct any errors or omissions they may discover and to make reports to their respective houses, from time to time, of the correctly enrolled bills or joint resolutions.All bills and joint resolutions shall be free from interlineations or erasures and any previous enrollment containing any interlineations or erasures destroyed.

(a) Whenever a measure of one house is amended in the other and the house in which it originated shall refuse to concur in the amendment, the house amending the measure may either insist or recede therefrom. But when a measure originating in one house is amended in the other, the house in which it originated may amend such amendment and a motion therefor shall take precedence of a motion to concur. If said house refuses to concur, the other house may either recede from or insist upon its amendment, and a motion to recede shall take precedence of a motion to insist.

If the motion to insist prevails, the house so insisting shall request a committee of conference on the subject of disagreement and shall appoint a committee therefor. The other house may thereupon appoint such committee. Unless a different number is agreed upon, such conference committee shall consist of three members from each house. Such committee shall consider and report upon only the subject matter of the amendment or amendments which were in disagreement, with necessary consequential changes. The committee shall meet at a convenient time, to be agreed upon by their Chairs, and upon notifying all conferees of the time and place of any such meeting, and having conferred freely, shall report to their respective houses the result of the conference. In case of agreement, the report shall be first made, with the papers referred accompanying it, to the house of origin, and there acted upon; and such action, with the papers referred, shall be immediately reported by the Clerk to the other house.

A "bill authorizing the promulgation of proposed legislative rules" or a "bill of authorization" is a measure intended to be enacted as general law, which incorporates by reference a proposed legislative rule, with or without amendments or substitutions set forth in the bill, and which authorizes the promulgation and implementation of the proposed legislative rule. The processing of bills authorizing the promulgation of proposed legislative rules shall be governed by the standing rules of the Senate and the House of Delegates, which are supplemented by the provisions of this joint rule. In the case of any conflict between this rule and a standing rule of the Senate or the House of Delegates, the provisions of this rule shall control. (1) The requirement of either house that bills shall be presented in duplicate applies to bills authorizing the promulgation of proposed legislative rules, but does not apply to the proposed legislative rule which the bill incorporates by reference. Of the duplicate copies, only the designated original copy shall have appended thereto the full text of the proposed legislative rule as finally approved by the agency seeking permission for its promulgation. Other copies of the full text of the proposed legislative rule shall be made available to members of the Legislature as hereinafter provided. (2) Copies of the full text of each proposed legislative rule shall be reproduced by printing or duplication by the Clerk prior to, or as soon as is reasonably practicable after, the introduction of the bill which would authorize by law the promulgation of the proposed legislative rule. Prior to such printing or duplication, a notation shall be affixed to the proposed legislative rule which identifies the bill number of the introduced bill which would authorize its promulgation and which also identifies the committee or committees of the house to which the bill is to be referred by the presiding officer following its introduction. Otherwise, the copies printed or duplicated shall conform to the copy of the proposed legislative rule appended to the original bill, so as to facilitate the consideration and amendment of the rule throughout the legislative process. (3) The Clerk shall furnish to any member, upon his or her request, without cost, one copy of the full text of a proposed legislative rule as reproduced by the Clerk in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2) of this Joint Rule. For any request for an additional copy or copies of the proposed legislative rule, the member requesting the copy or copies shall pay to the Clerk, in advance, a charge which the Clerk has reasonably determined to be adequate to cover the actual cost of the printing or duplication: Provided, That the provisions herein for the Clerk to furnish a member with an additional copy or copies, with a cost charged, may not interfere with or delay the prompt and otherwise timely consideration of bills of authorization by the house or its committees or subcommittees. (4) Whenever the standing rules of either house require the printing or reprinting of a bill, the rules apply to bills authorizing the promulgation of a proposed legislative rule with the same force and effect as they apply to other bills. However, no printing or reprinting of the proposed legislative rule which is incorporated by reference in the bill of authorization shall be required, other than the printing required by subsection (2) of this Joint Rule. (5) Whenever the standing rules of either house require a bill to be read, or fully and distinctly read, the rules apply to bills authorizing the promulgation of a proposed legislative rule with the same force and effect as they apply to other bills. However, no reading of the proposed legislative rule which is incorporated by reference in the bill of authorization shall be required. One House to Notify Other of Rejection of Bill6.
