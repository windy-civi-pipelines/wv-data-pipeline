THE WORKPLACE BULLYING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. §21-3F-1. Findings The Legislature finds that:(1) The social and economic well-being of the state is dependent upon healthy and productive employees;(2) Approximately one-third of all employees will directly experience health-endangering workplace bullying during their working lives;(3) Workplace bullying can negatively affect an employee’s mental and physical health and inflict serious harm, including, among other things, feelings of shame and humiliation, severe anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, impaired immune systems, hypertension, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and post-traumatic stress disorder;(4) Workplace bullying can have serious consequences for employers, including reduced employee productivity and morale, greater levels of fear and distrust, higher turnover and absenteeism rates, and increased demands on employee benefit programs, including health care coverage;(5) If employees who have been subjected to workplace bullying cannot establish that the behavior was motivated by protected class membership status such as race, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or age, or retaliation for engaging in protected whistleblowing, then they are unlikely to enjoy legal protection against such abuse;(6) Legal protection from abusive work environments should not be limited to behavior grounded in protected class status; and(7) Existing workers’ compensation plans, occupational safety and health laws, and common-law tort actions are inadequate to discourage workplace bullying or to provide relief to employees who have been harmed by workplace bullying. §21-3F-2. Purpose. The Legislature states the purpose of this article is to:(1) Create an enforceable duty of care for employers to engage in reasonable preventive and responsive actions to safeguard employees from workplace bullying; and (2) Abstain from retaliating against employees who act pursuant to their contractual rights under this article. §21-3F-3. Definitions. As used in this article:"Abusive work environment" means acts, omissions, or both, that a reasonable person would find constitutes an abusive work environment, based on the severity, nature, and frequency of the conduct, including, but not limited to: repeated verbal abuse such as targeted derogatory remarks, insults, epithets, or ridicule; verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a threatening, intimidating, or humiliating nature; defamatory statements that undermine an employee’s vocational and personal reputation; the sabotage or deliberate undermining of an employee’s work performance; and orchestrated patterns of ostracism.A single act normally shall not constitute an abusive work environment, but an especially severe and egregious act may meet this standard.Pertinent online communications and off-site conduct between employees shall be included in determining whether an abusive work environment exists.Conduct that exploits an employee’s known psychological or physical illness or disability shall be considered an aggravating factor in determining whether an abusive work environment exists.An adverse employment action and associated behaviors defined in this section shall be considered an aggravating factor in determining whether an abusive work environment exists."Adverse employment action" means an outcome that negatively impacts an employee, including but not limited to, termination, constructive discharge, suspension, or reduction in compensation."Constructive discharge" means an adverse employment action where: (1) the employee reasonably believed they were subjected to workplace bullying; (2) the employee resigned because of that mistreatment; and (3) the employer was aware of the workplace bullying prior to the resignation and failed to stop it."Psychological harm" means the impairment of a person’s mental health, as established by competent evidence."Physical harm" means the impairment of a person’s physical health or bodily integrity, as established by competent evidence."Retaliation" means retaliatory acts or omissions, by way of an adverse employment action or other material response that would dissuade a reasonable person from exercising their rights under this article, directed at an employee because they opposed any employment practice under this article, or made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation or proceeding under this article."Workplace bullying" means when an employer or one or more its employees subjects an employee to an abusive work environment that causes physical harm, psychological harm, or both. §21-3F-4.
