(c) Physician-patient or podiatrist-patient relationship through telemedicine encounter. –(1) A physician-patient or podiatrist-patient relationship may not be established through:Text-based communications such as e-mail, Internet questionnaires, text-based messaging, or other written forms of communication.(2) If an existing physician-patient or podiatrist-patient relationship does not exist prior to the utilization to telemedicine technologies, or if services are rendered solely through telemedicine technologies, a physician-patient or podiatrist-patient relationship may only be established:(A) Through the use of telemedicine technologies which incorporate interactive audio using store and forward technology, real-time videoconferencing, or similar secure video services during the initial physician-patient or podiatrist-patient encounter; (B) For the practice of pathology and radiology, a physician-patient relationship may be established through store and forward telemedicine or other similar technologies; or(C) Through the use of audio-only calls or conversations that occur in real time.

Treatment, including issuing a prescription, based solely on an online questionnaire, does not constitute an acceptable standard of care.(f) Patient records. –The patient record established during the use of telemedicine technologies shall be accessible and documented for both the physician or podiatrist and the patient, consistent with the laws and legislative rules governing patient health care records. All laws governing the confidentiality of health care information and governing patient access to medical records shall apply to records of practice of medicine or podiatry provided through telemedicine technologies.
