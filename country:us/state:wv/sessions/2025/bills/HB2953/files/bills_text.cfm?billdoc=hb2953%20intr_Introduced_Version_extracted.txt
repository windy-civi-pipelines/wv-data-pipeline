The notice shall be sufficiently prominent and robust to ensure that existing consumers can easily exercise their choices consistently with this article.(f) A business does not share personal information when:(1) A consumer uses or directs the business to intentionally disclose personal information or intentionally interact with one or more third parties.(2) The business uses or shares an identifier for a consumer who has opted-out of sharing the consumer's personal information for the purposes of alerting persons that the consumer has opted-out of sharing the consumer's personal information. §46A-9-7 Discrimination against consumers who exercise their right under this article.

The business may not require the consumer to create an account with the business in order to make a verifiable consumer request.(b) The business shall deliver the information required or act on the request to a consumer free of charge within 45 days after receiving a verifiable consumer request. The response period may be extended once by 30 additional days when reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity of the consumer's requests, provided the business informs the consumer of any such extension within the initial 45-day response period along with the reason for the extension. The information shall be delivered in a readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.(c) If a third party assumes control of all or part of a business and acquires a consumer's personal information as part of the transfer, and the third party materially alters how it uses a consumer's personal information or shares the information in a manner that is materially inconsistent with the promises made at the time of collection, the third party shall provide prior notice of the new or changed practice to the customer. The notice shall be sufficiently prominent and robust to ensure that existing consumers can easily exercise their choices.(d) Any contract between a business and a service provider shall prohibit the service provider from:(1) Selling or sharing the personal information;(2) Retaining, using, or disclosing the personal information for any purpose other than for the business purposes specified in the contract for the business, including retaining, using, or disclosing the personal information for a commercial purpose other than the business purposes specified in the contract with the business;(3) Retaining, using, or disclosing the information outside of the direct business relationship between the service provider and the business; or(4) Combining the personal information that the service provider receives from or on behalf of the business with personal information that it receives from or on behalf of another person or entity or that the service provider collects from its own interaction with the consumer, provided that the service provider may combine personal information to perform any business purpose.

A business that discloses personal information to a third party or service provider in compliance with this section is not liable if the person receiving the personal information uses it in violation of the restrictions under this article, provided that at the time of disclosing the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge or reason to believe that the person intends to commit such a violation. §46A-9-9. Form to opt-out of sale or sharing of personal information. (a)  A business shall, in a form that is reasonably accessible to consumers:(1)  Provide a clear and conspicuous link on the business's Internet homepage, entitled "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information," to an internet webpage that enables a consumer, or a person authorized by the consumer, to opt-out of the sale or sharing of the consumer's personal information.

Private cause of action. A consumer whose nonencrypted and nonredacted personal information or e-mail address, in combination with a password or security question and answer that would allow access to the account, is subject to an unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure as a result of a business' violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to protect the personal information may bring civil action for any of the following: (1) Damages in an amount not less than $100 and not greater than $750 per consumer per incident or actual damages, whichever is greater.(2) Injunctive or declaratory relief, as the court considers proper. §46A-9-11.  Enforcement and implementation.

The information shall be delivered in a readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.(c) If a third party assumes control of all or part of a business and acquires a consumer's personal information as part of the transfer, and the third party materially alters how it uses a consumer's personal information or shares the information in a manner that is materially inconsistent with the promises made at the time of collection, the third party shall provide prior notice of the new or changed practice to the customer. The notice shall be sufficiently prominent and robust to ensure that existing consumers can easily exercise their choices.(d) Any contract between a business and a service provider shall prohibit the service provider from:(1) Selling or sharing the personal information;(2) Retaining, using, or disclosing the personal information for any purpose other than for the business purposes specified in the contract for the business, including retaining, using, or disclosing the personal information for a commercial purpose other than the business purposes specified in the contract with the business;(3) Retaining, using, or disclosing the information outside of the direct business relationship between the service provider and the business; or(4) Combining the personal information that the service provider receives from or on behalf of the business with personal information that it receives from or on behalf of another person or entity or that the service provider collects from its own interaction with the consumer, provided that the service provider may combine personal information to perform any business purpose.
