Any draft bill prepared under this section shall contain a legislative finding that the rule is within the legislative intent of the statute which the rule is intended to implement, extend, apply, or interpret and shall be available for any member of the Legislature to introduce to the Legislature. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to clarify the nature of the statement of the economic impact that an agency is supposed to provide when it submits a proposed rule to the LRMRC.
