Red = new code to be enacted SENATE RESOLUTION 31(By Senators Weld, Jeffries, Grady, and Rucker)[Introduced March 13, 2025] Designating March 14, 2025, as Suicide Prevention Awareness Day at the Legislature.Whereas, Tragically, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in West Virginia, and the 2nd leading cause of death for individuals between the ages of 10 to 34; andWhereas, According to the CDC one American is lost to suicide every 11 minutes resulting in over 49,000 deaths each year; andWhereas, Suicide is the only leading cause of death in the United States that has increased every year for the past decade; andWhereas, It is estimated that over 1.6 million people attempt suicide each year; andWhereas, The Department of Public Health reports that in West Virginia, seventy-one percent of suicide deaths are from firearms and there are approximately 18.3 suicides per 100,000 West Virginians; andWhereas, Over ninety percent of the people who die by suicide have a diagnosable and treatable mental health condition, although their condition is not often recognized or treated; andWhereas, The stigma associated with mental health conditions and suicidality works against suicide prevention by both discouraging those who are at risk from seeking life-saving help, and traumatizing the survivors of suicide loss and those who have lived with the experience of suicide; andWhereas, Organizations such as The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention envision a world without suicide, and are dedicated to saving lives and bringing hope to those affected by suicide, through research, education, advocacy, and resources for those who have lost, or struggle with these urges; andWhereas, It is imperative we recognize suicide as a preventable national and state public health crisis and declare suicide prevention to be a priority.  Further, we must acknowledge that no single suicide prevention program or effort can or will be appropriate for all populations or communities, but well-placed initiatives based on the goals contained in the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and West Virginia’s strategy for suicide prevention are encouraged.  One such initiative is promoting awareness that there is no single cause for suicide, and that suicide most often occurs when stressors exceed the coping abilities of someone suffering from a mental health condition; andWhereas, It is absolutely critical that our state and nation develop and implement strategies to increase access to quality mental health and substance abuse treatment options, as well as suicide prevention services; therefore, be itResolved by the Senate:That the Senate hereby designates March 14, 2025, as Suicide Prevention Awareness Day at the Legislature; and, be itFurther Resolved, That the Clerk is hereby directed to forward a copy of this resolution to the appropriate representative of the West Virginia Chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.
