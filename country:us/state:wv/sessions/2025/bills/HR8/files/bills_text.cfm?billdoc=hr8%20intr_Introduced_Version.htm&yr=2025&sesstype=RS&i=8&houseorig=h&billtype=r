The requirements vary state by state. Some allow concealed carry without a permit, while other states require a permit; andWhereas, The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, (HR38), is a bill pending in Congress that would amend Title 18 of the United States Code to require all U.S. states to recognize concealed carry permits granted by other states that allow their residents to carry concealed weapons; andWhereas, U.S. Lawshield’s Kirk Evans said national concealed carry reciprocity would be similar to how states recognize driver's licenses from other states. "But the general concept is if you've got a concealed carry permit in, say, Virginia, then Illinois is going to be required to recognize that permit", Evans has been quoted as saying; andWhereas, Passage of The Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act would allow West Virginia residents with concealed carry weapons permits issued in this state to carry a concealed weapon in any state that allows their residents to carry concealed weapons without the worry and hassle of ascertaining the validity of his or her West Virginia permit in other states that have a statute under which residents of the state may apply for a license or permit to carry a concealed firearm, or does not prohibit the carrying of concealed firearms by residents of the state for lawful purposes; now, therefore, be itResolved by the House of Delegates:That the West Virginia House of Delegates requests that Congress pass the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act to allow West Virginians with West Virginia concealed carry weapons permits to carry concealed weapons in other states that allow their residents to carry concealed weapons, without concern about whether that state recognizes his or her West Virginia permit; and Further Resolved, that the Clerk of the House of Delegates forward a copy of this resolution to the West Virginia Congressional delegation.
