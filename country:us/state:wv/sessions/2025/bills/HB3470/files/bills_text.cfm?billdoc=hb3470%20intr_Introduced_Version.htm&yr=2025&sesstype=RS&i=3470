The bill establishes the minimum payment to be made by an insurer to an out-of-network emergency medical services agency for ambulance services.  The bill requires payment by the insurer directly to the out-of-network emergency medical services agency and the prompt payment of clean claims.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
