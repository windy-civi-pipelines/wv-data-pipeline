In the event the board believes parole should be granted, it may defer a final decision pending completion of an investigation and receipt of the commissioner&#39;s findings. Upon receipt of the plan, together with the investigation and findings, the board, through a panel, shall make a final decision regarding the granting or denial of parole; </span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(4) Has satisfied the board that if released on parole he or she will not constitute a danger to the community; and</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(5) Has successfully completed any individually required rehabilitative and educational programs, as determined by the division, while incarcerated: &nbsp;</span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided</span><span class="csE736517A">, That, effective September 1, 2021, any inmate who satisfies all other parole eligibility requirements but is unable, through no fault of the inmate, to complete his or her required rehabilitative and educational programs while incarcerated, which are eligible to be taken while on parole, may be granted parole with the completion of such specified programs outside of the correctional institutions being a special condition of that person&rsquo;s parole term: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided</span><span class="csE736517A">, </span><span class="cs50A3B802">however</span><span class="csE736517A">, That the Parole Board may consider whether completion of the inmate&#39;s outstanding amount of such programming would interfere with his or her successful reintegration into society.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(c) Except in the case of an inmate serving a life sentence, a person who has been previously twice convicted of a felony may not be released on parole until he or she has served the minimum term provided by law for the crime for which he or she was convicted.

The presumption created by this subdivision may be rebutted by a Parole Board finding that, according to the standardized risk and needs assessment, at the time parole release is sought the inmate still constitutes a reasonable risk to the safety or property of other persons if released. Nothing in subsection (b) of this section or in this subsection may be construed to create a right to parole.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the Parole Board may grant or deny parole to an inmate against whom a detainer is lodged by a jurisdiction other than West Virginia for service of a sentence of incarceration, upon a written request for parole from the inmate. A denial of parole under this subsection precludes consideration for parole for a period of one year or until the provisions of subsection (b) of this section are applicable.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(j) If an inmate is otherwise eligible for parole pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, and has completed the rehabilitation treatment program required under subdivision (1), subsection (h) of this section, the Parole Board may not require the inmate to participate in an additional program, but may determine that the inmate must complete an assigned task or tasks prior to actual release on parole. The board may grant parole contingently, effective upon successful completion of the assigned task or tasks, without the need for a further hearing.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(k) (1) The Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall supervise all probationers and parolees whose supervision may have been undertaken by this state by reason of any interstate compact entered into pursuant to the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Parolee Supervision.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) The Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation shall provide supervision, treatment/recovery, and support services for all persons released to mandatory supervision under &sect;15A-4-17 of this code.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(l) (1) When considering an inmate of a state correctional facility for release on parole, the Parole Board panel considering the parole shall have before it an authentic copy of, or report on, the inmate&#39;s current criminal record as provided through the West Virginia State Police, the United States Department of Justice, or any other reliable criminal information sources and written reports of the superintendent of the state correctional institution to which the inmate is sentenced:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(A) On the inmate&#39;s conduct record while in custody, including a detailed statement showing any and all infractions of disciplinary rules by the inmate and the nature and extent of discipline administered for the infractions;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(B) On the inmate&#39;s industrial record while in custody which shall include: The nature of his or her work, occupation or education, the average number of hours per day he or she has been employed or in class while in custody and a recommendation as to the nature and kinds of employment which he or she is best fitted to perform and in which the inmate is most likely to succeed when he or she leaves the state correctional institution; and</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(C) On any physical, mental, psychological, or psychiatric examinations of the inmate.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) The Parole Board panel considering the parole may waive the requirement of any report when not available or not applicable as to any inmate considered for parole but, in every case, shall enter in its record its reason for the waiver: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided</span><span class="csE736517A">, That in the case of an inmate who is incarcerated because the inmate has been found guilty of, or has pleaded guilty to, a felony under the provisions of &sect;61-8-12 of this code or under the provisions of &sect;61-8B-1 </span><span class="cs50A3B802">et seq</span><span class="csE736517A">. or &sect;61-8C-1 </span><span class="cs50A3B802">et seq</span><span class="csE736517A">. of this code, the Parole Board panel may not waive the report required by this subsection.

Progress reports of outpatient treatment are to be made at least every six months to the parole officer supervising the parolee. In addition, in such cases, the Parole Board shall inform the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the person was convicted of the parole hearing and shall request that the prosecuting attorney inform the Parole Board of the circumstances surrounding a conviction or plea of guilty, plea bargaining, and other background information that might be useful in its deliberations.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(m) Before releasing any inmate on parole, the Parole Board shall arrange for the inmate to appear in person before a Parole Board panel and the panel may examine and interrogate him or her on any matters pertaining to his or her parole, including reports before the Parole Board made pursuant to the provisions of this section: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided</span><span class="csE736517A">, That an inmate may appear by video teleconference if the members of the Parole Board panel conducting the examination are able to contemporaneously see the inmate and hear all of his or her remarks and if the inmate is able to contemporaneously see each of the members of the panel conducting the examination and hear all of the members&#39; remarks: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided</span><span class="csE736517A">, </span><span class="cs50A3B802">however</span><span class="csE736517A">, That the requirement that an inmate personally appear may be waived where a physician authorized to do so by the Commissioner of the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation certifies that the inmate, due to a medical condition or disease, is too debilitated, either physically or cognitively, to appear.
