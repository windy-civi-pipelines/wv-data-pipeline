USE OF DIESEL-POWERED EQUIPMENT IN UNDERGROUND COAL MINES. §22A-2A-101. Use of diesel-powered equipment authorized. Diesel-powered equipment for use in underground coal mines may only be approved, operated and maintained in accordance with rules, requirements and standards established pursuant to this article: Provided, That diesel-powered equipment may be moved from one mine in the state to another mine in the state, and operated immediately, so long as the equipment is in compliance with the provisions of this article and the director is notified before the equipment is put in service.§22A-2A-308. Director's authority to promulgate legislative rules; continuation of rules adopted by the commission Authority of the Director to propose rules. (a) The director has the power and authority to propose legislative rules to carry out and implement the provisions of this article in accordance with the provisions of article three, chapter twenty-nine-a of this code. In proposing rules for legislative approval, the director shall consider the highest achievable measures of protection for miners' health and safety through available technology, engineering controls and performance requirements and shall further consider the cost, availability, adaptability and suitability of any available technology, engineering controls and performance requirements as they relate to the use of diesel equipment in underground coal mines. The Director of the Office of Miners' Health, Safety, and Training may propose rules for legislative approval necessary to carry out the provisions of this article in accordance with the provisions of §29A-3-1 et seq. of this code. Any rule promulgated under this section may not be more burdensome than the federal MSHA regulations as provided in 30 CFR 75.1900 et seq. as the provisions of such regulations exist on July 1, 2025. Any provision of rule, policy, internal procedure, or directive that is contrary to this section or more burdensome than said MSHA regulations is null and void and shall be removed.

Director's authority to approve site-specific experimental testing prior to initial rules Testing requirements for diesel equipment. The director may approve limited site-specific requests for experimental and testing use of diesel-powered equipment in underground coal mines prior to promulgation of initial rules in accordance with subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g), section three hundred ten of this article.Site-specific testing of diesel-powered equipment is no longer required once the equipment has been approved for use under 30 CFR Part 7, Subpart E. §22A-2A-310. Duties of director Additional regulatory limitations on the director's authority. (a) It is the duty of the director to carry out and implement this article and to evaluate and adopt state-of-the-art technology and methods, reflected in engines and engine components, emission control equipment and procedures, which when applied to diesel-powered underground mining machinery, shall reasonably reduce or eliminate diesel exhaust emissions and enhance protections of the health and safety of miners. The technology and methods adopted by the director shall have been demonstrated to be reliable. In making a decision to adopt new technology and methods, the director shall consider the highest achievable measures of protection for miners' health and safety through available technology, engineering controls and performance requirements and shall further consider the cost, availability, adaptability and suitability of any available technology, engineering controls and performance requirements as they relate to the use of diesel equipment in underground coal mines. Any state-of-the-art technology or methods adopted by the director shall not reduce or compromise the level of health and safety protection of miners.(b) Upon application of a coal mine operator, the director shall consider site-specific requests for the use of diesel equipment in underground coal mines and for the use of alternative diesel-related health and safety technologies and methods. The director's action on applications submitted under this subsection shall be on a mine-by-mine basis. Upon receipt of a site-specific application, the director shall investigate, which investigation shall include consultation with the mine operator and the authorized representatives of the miners at the mine. Authorized representatives of the miners shall include a mine health and safety committee elected by miners at the mine, a person or persons employed by an employee organization representing miners at the mine or a person or persons authorized as the representative or representatives of miners of the mine in accordance with MSHA regulations at 30 C. F. R. Pt. 40 (relating to representative of miners). Where there is no authorized representative of the miners, the director shall consult with a reasonable number of miners at the mine. Upon completion of the investigation, the director may approve the application for the site-specific request. (1) Within one hundred eighty days of receipt of an application for use of alternative technologies or methods, the director shall complete its investigation. However, the director has an additional one hundred eighty days to complete investigations upon applications filed prior to the effective date of the reenactment of this section. The time period may be extended with the consent of the applicant.(2) The director shall have thirty days upon completion of the investigation in which to render a final decision approving or rejecting the application.(3) The director may not approve an application made under this section if, at the conclusion of the investigation, the director determines that the use of the alternative technology or method will reduce or compromise the level of health and safety protection of miners.(4) The written approval of an application for the use of alternative technologies or methods shall include the results of the director's investigation and describe the specific conditions of use for the alternative technology or method.(5) The written decision to reject an application for the use of alternative technologies or methods shall include the results of the director's investigation and shall outline in detail the basis for the rejection.(c) The director shall establish conditions for the use of diesel-powered equipment in shaft and slope construction operations at coal mines.(d) The director shall have access to the services of the Board of Coal Mine Health and Safety necessary for the director to implement and carry out the provisions of this article.
