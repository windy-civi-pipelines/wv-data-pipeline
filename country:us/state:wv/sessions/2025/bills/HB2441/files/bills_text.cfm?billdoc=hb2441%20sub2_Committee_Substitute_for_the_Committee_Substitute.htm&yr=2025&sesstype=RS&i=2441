	<p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">Upon the determination of the facts by the commissioner, an individual is disqualified for benefits:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(1) For the week in which he or she left his or her most recent work voluntarily without good cause involving fault on the part of the employer and until the individual returns to covered employment and has been employed in covered employment at least 30 working days.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">For the purpose of this subdivision, an individual has not left his or her most recent work voluntarily without good cause involving fault on the part of the employer if the individual leaves his or her most recent work with an employer and if he or she in fact, within a 14-day calendar period, does return to employment with the last preceding employer with whom he or she was previously employed within the past year prior to his or her return to work, and which last preceding employer, after having previously employed the individual for 30 working days or more, laid off the individual because of lack of work, which layoff occasioned the payment of benefits under this chapter or could have occasioned the payment of benefits under this chapter had the individual applied for benefits. It is the intent of this paragraph to cause no disqualification for benefits for an individual who complies with the foregoing set of requirements and conditions. Further, for the purpose of this subdivision, an individual has not left his or her most recent work voluntarily without good cause involving fault on the part of the employer, if the individual was compelled to leave his or her work for his or her own health-related reasons and notifies the employer prior to leaving the job or within two business days after leaving the job or as soon as practicable and presents written certification from a licensed physician within 30 days of leaving the job that his or her work aggravated, worsened, or will worsen the individual&rsquo;s health problem.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) For the week in which he or she was discharged from his or her most recent work for misconduct and the six weeks immediately following that week; or for the week in which he or she was discharged from his or her last 30-day employing unit for misconduct and the six weeks immediately following that week. The disqualification carries a reduction in the maximum benefit amount equal to six times the individual&rsquo;s weekly benefit. However, if the claimant returns to work in covered employment for 30 days during his or her benefit year, whether or not the days are consecutive, the maximum benefit amount is increased by the amount of the decrease imposed under the disqualification; except that:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">If he or she were discharged from his or her most recent work for one of the following reasons, or if he or she were discharged from his or her last 30 days employing unit for one of the following reasons: Gross misconduct consisting of willful destruction of his or her employer&rsquo;s property; assault upon the person of his or her employer or any employee of his or her employer; if the assault is committed at the individual&rsquo;s place of employment or in the course of employment; reporting to work in an intoxicated condition, or being intoxicated while at work; reporting to work under the influence of any controlled substance, as defined in chapter 60A of this code without a valid prescription, or being under the influence of any controlled substance, as defined in said chapter without a valid prescription, while at work; adulterating or otherwise manipulating a sample or specimen in order to thwart a drug or alcohol test lawfully required of an employee; refusal to submit to, </span><span class="csF2E808A1">or failure of,</span><span class="csE736517A"> random testing for alcohol or illegal controlled substances for employees </span><a name="_Hlk191376497"></a><a name="_Hlk191376724"><span class="csF2E808A1">in an employment position where alcohol or drug use creates an inherent risk to the health and safety of the employee or others, or employees </span><span class="csE736517A">in safety-sensitive positions as defined in &sect;21-1D-2</span></a><span class="csE736517A"> of this code; violation of an employer&rsquo;s drug-free workplace program; violation of an employer&rsquo;s alcohol-free workplace program; arson, theft, larceny, fraud, or embezzlement in connection with his or her work; or any other gross misconduct, he or she is disqualified for benefits until he or she has thereafter worked for at least 30 days in covered employment: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided,</span><span class="csE736517A"> That for the purpose of this subdivision, the words &quot;any other gross misconduct&quot; includes, but is not limited to, any act or acts of misconduct where the individual has received prior written warning that termination of employment may result from the act or acts.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(3) For the week in which he or she failed without good cause to apply for available, suitable work, accept suitable work when offered, or return to his or her customary self-employment when directed to do so by the commissioner, and for the four weeks which immediately follow for such additional period as any offer of suitable work shall continue open for his or her acceptance. The disqualification carries a reduction in the maximum benefit amount equal to four times the individual&rsquo;s weekly benefit amount.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(4) For any week or portion thereof in which he or she did not work as a result of:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(a) A strike or other bona fide labor dispute which caused him or her to leave or lose his or her employment. </span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(b) A lockout is not a strike or a bona fide labor dispute and no individual may be denied benefits by reason of a lockout. However, the operation of a facility by nonstriking employees of the company, contractors, or other personnel is not a reason to grant employees of the company on strike unemployment compensation benefit payments. &nbsp;If the operation of a facility is with workers hired to permanently replace the employees on strike, the employees would be eligible for benefits.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(c) For the purpose of this subsection, an individual shall be determined to leave or lose his or her employment by reason of a lockout where the individual employee has established that: (i) The individual presented himself or herself physically for work at the workplace on the first day of such lockout or on the first day he or she is able to present himself at the workplace or herself; and (ii) the employer denied the individual the opportunity to perform work.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(d) For purposes of this subsection, an individual is determined to be permanently replaced where the individual employee establishes that: (i) He or she is currently employed by an employer who is the subject of a strike or other bona fide labor dispute; and (ii) the position of the employee has been occupied by another employee who has been notified they are permanently replacing the employee who previously occupied the position. Employees or contractors who are hired to perform striking employees&rsquo; work on a temporary basis, such as the duration of a strike or other bona fide labor dispute, or a shorter period of time, may not be determined to have permanently replaced a striking employee. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(5) For a week with respect to which he or she is receiving or has received:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(a) Wages in lieu of notice;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(b) Compensation for temporary total disability under the workers&rsquo;

A claimant may be required to certify as to whether or not he or she is receiving or has been receiving remuneration in the form of an annuity, pension, or other retirement pay from a base period employer or chargeable employer or from a trust fund contributed to by a base period employer or chargeable employer.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(13) For each week in which and for 52 weeks thereafter, beginning with the date of the decision, if the commissioner finds the individual who within 24 calendar months immediately preceding the decision, has made a false statement or representation knowing it to be false or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact, to obtain or increase any benefit or payment under this article: </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Provided,</span><span class="csE736517A"> That disqualification under this subdivision does not preclude prosecution under &sect;21A-10-7 of this code.</span></p><p class="csDE8452F9"><span class="csAD690475">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csDE8452F9"><span class="csAD690475">NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to provide that a person, who fails a random testing for alcohol or illegal controlled substances for employees in safety-sensitive positions, is disqualified for unemployment compensation benefits.</span></p><p class="csDE8452F9"><span class="csAD690475">Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.</span></p><p class="csBA891411"><span class="csA9049697">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="csBA891411"><span class="csA9049697">&nbsp;</span></p>
