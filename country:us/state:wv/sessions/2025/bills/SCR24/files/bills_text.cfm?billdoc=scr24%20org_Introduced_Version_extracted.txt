Whereas, The state of West Virginia has historically faced a shortage of medical professionals, including physicians, with this shortage disproportionately impacting rural areas of our state; andWhereas, In addition to the shortage of medical professionals in the state of West Virginia, much of the United States is similarly facing a shortage of medical professionals, including physicians, and data suggests that the shortage is projected to grow over the course of the next 10 years; andWhereas, Notwithstanding the shortage of physicians throughout the country, the number of qualified medical school applicants for residency programs has steadily grown over the course of the preceding 20 years, and these residency programs have not grown at a sufficient rate to accommodate the rising number of qualified medical school applicants; andWhereas, A significant number of medical school students remain unmatched with a residency program each year, which can halt their aspirations of becoming licensed medical practitioners and could further impose significant financial hardships in the repayment of student loans that were used to obtain a medical degree; andWhereas, The Legislature believes it may be productive and beneficial to explore opportunities for working cooperatively to address these issues through: (1) Ensuring an adequate number of residency programs are available to medical school graduates; and (2) the consideration of other means to resolve these issues in a manner that lets aspiring physicians meaningfully contribute to the health care system while simultaneously working towards the fulfillment of the physician residency requirement; andWhereas, The Legislature believes that it is in the best interests of the citizens of this state to give consideration to the feasibility of an Unmatched Medical Graduate Advisory Council charged with: (i) The examining the issues of unmatched medical school graduates; and (ii) providing recommendations on potentially continuing their medical training in West Virginia while simultaneously fulfilling the increasing need for medical professionals within the state of West Virginia; therefore, be itResolved by the Legislature of West Virginia:That the Joint committee on Government and Finance study the issues of unmatched medical students unable to gain admission into residency programs and opportunities for simultaneously addressing the shortage of medical professionals in the state of West Virginia; and, be itFurther Resolved, That the Joint Committee on Government and Finance is hereby requested to study the issues set forth in this resolution and is further requested to give additional consideration to: Allowing otherwise qualified medical school graduates who do not match to a residency program to intern with a licensed physician in the state of West Virginia; (ii) 	Exploring ways to counter the funding shortage from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for hospital residency programs, including raising the existing cap, requiring hospitals to pay more for residents’ cost, and allowing doctors to contribute toward the cost of their residency training; and Any other recommendations determined by the study to be viable options to address the issues identified in this resolution; and, be it Further Resolved, That the Joint Committee on Government and Finance report to the regular session of the Legislature, 2026, on its findings, conclusions, and recommendations, together with drafts of any legislation necessary to effectuate its recommendations; and, be itFurther Resolved, That the expenses necessary to conduct this study, to prepare a report, and to draft necessary legislation be paid from legislative appropriations to the Joint Committee on Government and Finance.
