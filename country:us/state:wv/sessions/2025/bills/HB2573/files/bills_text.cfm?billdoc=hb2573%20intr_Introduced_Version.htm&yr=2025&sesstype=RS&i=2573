Personal Income Tax. Part II. Residents. §11-21-27. Exemption for families with four or more children. (a) The Legislature finds and determines that:(1) Families are the cornerstone of society and play a vital role in West Virginia's economic stability, security, and growth; and(2) Supporting large families contributes to a stable and growing population, which is essential for the long-term economic health and workforce sustainability of West Virginia; and(3) Families face unique and significant financial burdens, including expenses for education, healthcare, and general living; and(4) Encouraging larger families aligns with West Virginia's commitment to promoting the institution of the family and ensuring a nurturing environment for children. Providing tax relief to families with four or more children reflects the state's recognition of the vital contributions these families make to the community.(5) The current state tax code does not adequately address the unique financial challenges faced by larger families and fails to recognize their contribution to the future social and economic well-being of West Virginia.(6) Studies confirm that children who are raised by their married parents enjoy better life outcomes, including increased math and reading skills by the end of elementary school, higher college graduation rates, higher individual earnings at age 30, and decreased likelihood of criminal conviction or dependence as a public charge.
