If the Attorney General finds that a person has violated or is violating §14-4-2(a), the Attorney General may bring a civil action under this section against that person. §14-4-4.  Civil actions by individuals as qui tam plaintiff and as private citizens. (a) A person may bring a civil action for a violation of this article for the person and for the state in the name of the state. The person bringing the action shall be referred to as the qui tam plaintiff. Once filed, the action may be dismissed only with the written consent of the court and the Attorney General, considering the best interest of the parties involved and the public purposes behind this article.(b) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses shall be served on the Attorney General. The complaint shall also be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days and may not be served on the defendant until the court so orders. The state may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after it receives both the complaint and the material evidence and the information. Any information or documents furnished by the relator to the Attorney General in connection with the initiation of a qui tam action or investigation under this subdivision is not a public record and is exempt from disclosure under chapter twenty-nine-b of this code.(c) The state may, for good cause shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains under seal under §14-4-4(b). Any such motions may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant may not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant pursuant to West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure.(d) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under §14-4-4(c), the Attorney General shall review the action and shall issue findings that:(1) The cause has a reasonable basis in fact and that the Attorney General's office shall proceed with the action, in which case the Attorney General shall intervene and conduct the action on behalf of the state;(2) The cause has a reasonable basis in fact but the Attorney General's office declines to proceed with the action, in which case the Attorney General shall notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the person bringing the action shall have the right to conduct the action; or(3) In any claims other than those for claims brought for fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program, if the cause does not have a reasonable basis in fact, it may not proceed: Provided, That any finding by the Attorney General that the cause is not meritorious is subject to an en banc review by the West Virginia Intermediate Court of Appeals, which may approve or reverse that finding.  If the person bringing the civil action elects to seek review of the finding, he or she shall file his request upon forms provided by the court for that purpose within 60 days after receipt of the finding and deliver a copy of the form to the Attorney General.  Within 60 days after receipt of a copy of the form, the Attorney General shall deliver to the Intermediate Court of Appeals copies of the complaint and all evidence and information provided by the person bringing the civil action together with copies of all evidence developed by the Attorney General during his investigation. If, upon review, the West Virginia Intermediate Court of Appeals finds that the cause has a reasonable basis in fact, then the cause may proceed under §14-4-5(d)(2).(e) When a person brings a valid action under this section, no person other than the state may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.(f) In any action brought under the provisions of this section, the Attorney General, or any other person bringing the action, shall prove all essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence. §14-4-5.  Rights of the parties to qui tam actions. (a) If the Attorney General proceeds with the action, he or she has the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and may not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action.  That person may continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in §14-4-5(b).(b)(1) The Attorney General may seek to dismiss the action for good cause notwithstanding the objections of the qui tam plaintiff if the qui tam plaintiff has been notified by the Attorney General of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the qui tam plaintiff with an opportunity to oppose the motion and present evidence at a hearing. (A) Upon a hearing on the Attorney General's motion to dismiss the action, the court shall consider, and is authorized to grant, a proposal by the qui tam plaintiff to proceed with the action without the Attorney General's participation. (B) Any award resulting from an action authorized by the court pursuant to §14-4-5(b)(1)(A) shall be made pursuant to §14-4-6. (2) The Attorney General may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the qui tam plaintiff if the court determines, after a hearing providing the qui tam plaintiff an opportunity to present evidence, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all of the circumstances.(3) Upon a showing by the Attorney General that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would interfere with or unduly delay the Attorney General's prosecution of the case or would be repetitious, irrelevant or for purposes of harassment, the court may impose limitations on the person's participation, such as:(A) Limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;(B) Limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses;(C) Limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or(D) Otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation.(4) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation by the person in the litigation. (c) If the Attorney General elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action may conduct the action. If the Attorney General so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied with copies of all deposition transcripts at the state's expense. When a person proceeds with the action the court, without limiting the status and rights of the person initiating the action, may nevertheless permit the Attorney General to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.(d) Whether or not the Attorney General proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the state that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the action would interfere with the state's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further showing in camera that the state has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings. (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of §14-4-4, the state may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the state, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the action has the same rights in that proceeding as the person would have had if the action had continued under §14-4-4. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under §14-4-4.  A finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the state, if all time for filing an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review. §14-4-6.  Award to qui tam plaintiff. (a) (1) In any claims brought for fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program, if the Attorney General proceeds with an action brought by a person under §14-4-4, that person shall receive at least 15  percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Where the action is one that the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information, other than information provided by the person bringing the action, relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a legislative, administrative, or state auditor's report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs prior to the attorney general's intervention. All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.(2) In any claims other than those for claims brought for fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program, if the Attorney General proceeds with an action brought by a person under §14-4-4, that person shall receive not more than 20 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, or $250,000 whichever is lesser, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Where the action is one that the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information, other than information provided by the person bringing the action, relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a legislative, administrative, or state auditor's report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a person shall be made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs prior to the Attorney General's intervention. All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.(b)(1) If the Attorney General does not proceed with an action under §14-4-4, in any claims brought for fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of the proceeds. The person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred.  All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.(2) If the Attorney General does not proceed with an action under §14-4-4, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount may not exceed more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of the proceeds; nor, in any circumstance, shall the award exceed $1,000,000 absent a specific finding by the judge that such award is necessary and proper based upon specific factual circumstances unique to the action. The person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, which, at the court's discretion may include reasonable attorneys' fees and costs up to an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the plaintiff's recovery. All expenses, fees, and costs are the contractual obligation of the person bringing the action and are not the responsibility of the state; Provided, the court shall award to the defendant its reasonable attorney's fees and expenses against the person bringing the civil action if the defendant prevails in the civil action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the civil action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment. (c) Whether or not the Attorney General proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of §14-4-2 upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under §14-4-6(a) or §14-4-6(b), taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of §14-4-2, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and may not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. The dismissal does not prejudice the right of the state to continue the action.(d) Following any distributions under sections §14-4-6(a), §14-4-6(b), or §14-4-6(c) the agency injured by the submission of a false claim shall be awarded an amount not to exceed its compensatory damages. All remaining proceeds, including civil penalties awarded under this article, shall be deposited in accordance with §14-4-12. §14-4-7.  Certain actions barred. (a) Except in any claim brought for fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program, a court does not have jurisdiction over an action brought under §14-4-4, based on information discovered by a present or former employee of the state during the course of his employment unless that employee, first, in good faith, exhausted existing internal procedures for reporting and seeking recovery of the falsely claimed sums through official channels and unless the state failed to act on the information provided within a reasonable period of time.

The relief shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status the employee, contractor, or agent would have had but for the discrimination, two times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorney's fees.(b) An employee, contractor or agent may bring an action in the appropriate court for the relief provided under this section. The action may not be brought under this section more than three years after the last act of the employer that is alleged to violate this section. (c) Any state employee who has suffered as a result of lawful acts done by the employee, contractor, agent, or associated others in furtherance of an action brought or to be brought under §14-4-3 or §14-4-4, or other efforts to stop one or more violations of this article may pursue a grievance under the West Virginia Public Employees Grievance Procedure, or through a local grievance process, if applicable: Provided, That, any relief awarded to an employee under this section shall be reduced by any amount awarded to the employee through a state or local grievance process.(d) Nothing in this article may disparage impair or limit any other right or legal action of an employee, contractor, or agent. §14-4-10.  Limitation of actions; activities antedating this article; burden of proof.

(a) A person may bring a civil action for a violation of this article for the person and for the state in the name of the state. The person bringing the action shall be referred to as the qui tam plaintiff. Once filed, the action may be dismissed only with the written consent of the court and the Attorney General, considering the best interest of the parties involved and the public purposes behind this article.(b) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses shall be served on the Attorney General. The complaint shall also be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days and may not be served on the defendant until the court so orders. The state may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after it receives both the complaint and the material evidence and the information. Any information or documents furnished by the relator to the Attorney General in connection with the initiation of a qui tam action or investigation under this subdivision is not a public record and is exempt from disclosure under chapter twenty-nine-b of this code.(c) The state may, for good cause shown, move the court for extensions of the time during which the complaint remains under seal under §14-4-4(b). Any such motions may be supported by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant may not be required to respond to any complaint filed under this section until after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the defendant pursuant to West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure.(d) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under §14-4-4(c), the Attorney General shall review the action and shall issue findings that:(1) The cause has a reasonable basis in fact and that the Attorney General's office shall proceed with the action, in which case the Attorney General shall intervene and conduct the action on behalf of the state;(2) The cause has a reasonable basis in fact but the Attorney General's office declines to proceed with the action, in which case the Attorney General shall notify the court that it declines to take over the action, in which case the person bringing the action shall have the right to conduct the action; or(3) In any claims other than those for claims brought for fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program, if the cause does not have a reasonable basis in fact, it may not proceed: Provided, That any finding by the Attorney General that the cause is not meritorious is subject to an en banc review by the West Virginia Intermediate Court of Appeals, which may approve or reverse that finding.  If the person bringing the civil action elects to seek review of the finding, he or she shall file his request upon forms provided by the court for that purpose within 60 days after receipt of the finding and deliver a copy of the form to the Attorney General.  Within 60 days after receipt of a copy of the form, the Attorney General shall deliver to the Intermediate Court of Appeals copies of the complaint and all evidence and information provided by the person bringing the civil action together with copies of all evidence developed by the Attorney General during his investigation. If, upon review, the West Virginia Intermediate Court of Appeals finds that the cause has a reasonable basis in fact, then the cause may proceed under §14-4-5(d)(2).(e) When a person brings a valid action under this section, no person other than the state may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.(f) In any action brought under the provisions of this section, the Attorney General, or any other person bringing the action, shall prove all essential elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence. §14-4-5.  Rights of the parties to qui tam actions. (a) If the Attorney General proceeds with the action, he or she has the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and may not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action.  That person may continue as a party to the action, subject to the limitations set forth in §14-4-5(b).(b)(1) The Attorney General may seek to dismiss the action for good cause notwithstanding the objections of the qui tam plaintiff if the qui tam plaintiff has been notified by the Attorney General of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the qui tam plaintiff with an opportunity to oppose the motion and present evidence at a hearing. (A) Upon a hearing on the Attorney General's motion to dismiss the action, the court shall consider, and is authorized to grant, a proposal by the qui tam plaintiff to proceed with the action without the Attorney General's participation. (B) Any award resulting from an action authorized by the court pursuant to §14-4-5(b)(1)(A) shall be made pursuant to §14-4-6. (2) The Attorney General may settle the action with the defendant notwithstanding the objections of the qui tam plaintiff if the court determines, after a hearing providing the qui tam plaintiff an opportunity to present evidence, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all of the circumstances.(3) Upon a showing by the Attorney General that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would interfere with or unduly delay the Attorney General's prosecution of the case or would be repetitious, irrelevant or for purposes of harassment, the court may impose limitations on the person's participation, such as:(A) Limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;(B) Limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses;(C) Limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or(D) Otherwise limiting the participation by the person in the litigation.(4) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation by the person in the litigation. (c) If the Attorney General elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action may conduct the action. If the Attorney General so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied with copies of all deposition transcripts at the state's expense. When a person proceeds with the action the court, without limiting the status and rights of the person initiating the action, may nevertheless permit the Attorney General to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause.(d) Whether or not the Attorney General proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the state that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the action would interfere with the state's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further showing in camera that the state has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings. (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of §14-4-4, the state may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the state, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the action has the same rights in that proceeding as the person would have had if the action had continued under §14-4-4. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under §14-4-4.  A finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the state, if all time for filing an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review. §14-4-6.  Award to qui tam plaintiff. (a) (1) In any claims brought for fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program, if the Attorney General proceeds with an action brought by a person under §14-4-4, that person shall receive at least 15  percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Where the action is one that the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information, other than information provided by the person bringing the action, relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a legislative, administrative, or state auditor's report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs prior to the attorney general's intervention. All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.(2) In any claims other than those for claims brought for fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program, if the Attorney General proceeds with an action brought by a person under §14-4-4, that person shall receive not more than 20 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim, or $250,000 whichever is lesser, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. Where the action is one that the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information, other than information provided by the person bringing the action, relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a legislative, administrative, or state auditor's report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a person shall be made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs prior to the Attorney General's intervention. All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.(b)(1) If the Attorney General does not proceed with an action under §14-4-4, in any claims brought for fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of the proceeds. The person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred.  All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.(2) If the Attorney General does not proceed with an action under §14-4-4, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount may not exceed more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of the proceeds; nor, in any circumstance, shall the award exceed $1,000,000 absent a specific finding by the judge that such award is necessary and proper based upon specific factual circumstances unique to the action. The person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, which, at the court's discretion may include reasonable attorneys' fees and costs up to an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the plaintiff's recovery. All expenses, fees, and costs are the contractual obligation of the person bringing the action and are not the responsibility of the state; Provided, the court shall award to the defendant its reasonable attorney's fees and expenses against the person bringing the civil action if the defendant prevails in the civil action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the civil action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment. (c) Whether or not the Attorney General proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of §14-4-2 upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action which the person would otherwise receive under §14-4-6(a) or §14-4-6(b), taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of §14-4-2, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and may not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. The dismissal does not prejudice the right of the state to continue the action.(d) Following any distributions under sections §14-4-6(a), §14-4-6(b), or §14-4-6(c) the agency injured by the submission of a false claim shall be awarded an amount not to exceed its compensatory damages. All remaining proceeds, including civil penalties awarded under this article, shall be deposited in accordance with §14-4-12. §14-4-7.  Certain actions barred. (a) Except in any claim brought for fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program, a court does not have jurisdiction over an action brought under §14-4-4, based on information discovered by a present or former employee of the state during the course of his employment unless that employee, first, in good faith, exhausted existing internal procedures for reporting and seeking recovery of the falsely claimed sums through official channels and unless the state failed to act on the information provided within a reasonable period of time.

The relief shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status the employee, contractor, or agent would have had but for the discrimination, two times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorney's fees.(b) An employee, contractor or agent may bring an action in the appropriate court for the relief provided under this section.
