(1) Rehabilitation of Native Wildlife -- A licensed veterinarian or animal control agency may also receive, temporarily confine, provide medical and supportive care to, release or humanely dispatch orphaned, injured or ill native wildlife for emergency treatment without a wildlife rehabilitator permit if the native wildlife is not held for more than 48 hours before contacting the division of wildlife resources or a permitted wildlife rehabilitator to confirm the animal will be accepted. Native wildlife shall be transferred to a properly permitted wildlife rehabilitator as soon as specialized care is no longer required.(2) Any person may capture and transport injured, orphaned, or ill native wildlife, without unnecessary delay, directly to a permitted wildlife rehabilitator, division employee, licensed veterinarian, or animal control agency authorized to possess these animals, but only after contacting the facility and confirming that the animal will be accepted. Prior to transport, no care may be provided to native wildlife unless directed by the permitted wildlife rehabilitator or division employee.(3) Releasable native wildlife may not be intentionally tamed or kept longer than is required for the restoration of its health. If an animal becomes habituated or has a medical diagnosis preventing release, non-releasable native wildlife may be held under the authority of a licensed wildlife rehabilitator permit for educational programs or exhibits. The animal may also be transferred to a licensed zoological park, museum, or entity approved and authorized by the director.(4) Native wildlife that is being improperly cared for, as determined by the Minimum Standards for Wildlife Rehabilitation (MSWR), may be removed by a division wildlife officer. Prior to a removal, the permittee must be given written notice stating what deficiencies exist and be given at least 14 days to correct any such deficiencies.(5) Native Wildlife Rehabilitation Permit --  Wildlife rehabilitators shall provide proof of certification through the International Wildlife Rehabilitators Council or be a licensed veterinarian in order to be considered eligible for this permit.No one convicted of a state or federal wildlife crime may be considered eligible for this permit.Wildlife rehabilitators shall have facilities established which are in accordance with the Minimum Standards for Wildlife Rehabilitation to be approved by inspection from the Division of Wildlife Resources prior to being granted this permit and accepting native wildlife for rehabilitation.In order to obtain a Wildlife Rehabilitation Permit, the individual shall provide a letter of competence from a licensed veterinarian, zoological facility, or other licensed West Virginia rehabilitator stating that they are able to properly care for native wildlife that has been orphaned, injured or ill.(6) Records of all native wildlife cared for by a wildlife rehabilitator shall be kept detailing the date of intake, species of animal, circumstances of intake, and circumstances and date of final disposition to be submitted to the Division of Wildlife Resources annually. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to permit individuals, referred to as a “Wildlife Rehabilitator”, to capture and transport, receive, temporarily confine, provide medical and supportive care to release and humanely dispatch orphaned, injured or ill native wildlife provided that the methods and documentation for such activities are in accordance with permit conditions set forth by the director of the Division of Wildlife Resources.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
