All courses included in the approved transfer pathways shall be accepted as meeting general education or program-specific requirements at the receiving institution. The commission and council may, upon the recommendation of the chancellors, approve exceptions to this requirement in cases where such arrangements would present a hardship to the institution, cause the institution to be in violation of standards established by regional or program-specific accrediting bodies, or for other good cause shown.(h) The commission and council shall propose rules for legislative approval in accordance with the provisions of §18B-1-6 and §29A-3A-1 et seq. of this code to implement the provisions of this section. The Clerk of the House of Delegates and the Clerk of the Senate hereby certify that the foregoing bill is correctly enrolled.  ...............................................................
