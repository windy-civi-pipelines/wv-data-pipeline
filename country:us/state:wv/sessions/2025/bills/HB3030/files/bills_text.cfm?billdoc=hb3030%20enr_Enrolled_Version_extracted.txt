The applicant shall submit the appropriate fee to the department with the application filed pursuant to this article for any state water pollution control permit or national pollutant discharge elimination system permit.

The secretary may declare any permit issued pursuant to this article void when the annual permit fee is more than 90 days past due. Voiding of the permit will only become effective upon the date the secretary mails, by certified mail, written notice to the permittee’s last known address notifying the permittee that the permit has been voided.(e) The secretary shall file a quarterly report with the Joint Committee on Government and Finance setting forth the fees established and collected pursuant to this section.(f) On July 1, 2022, and each year thereafter a $1,000 fee shall be assessed for permit applications and a $3,000 fee shall be assessed for permit renewals for surface coal mining operations, as defined in §22-3-1 et seq. of this code.
