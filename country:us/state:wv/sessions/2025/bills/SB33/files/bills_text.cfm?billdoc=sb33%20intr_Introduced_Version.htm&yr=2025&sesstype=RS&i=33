All contracts below $150,000 in total consideration shall be exclusively set aside for small businesses if at least one small business competitively bids and is able to perform at a price at or below fair market value. All contracts between $150,000 and $700,000 in total consideration shall be set aside for small businesses only if two or more small businesses competitively bid and are able to perform at or below fair market value.(d) In calculating the percentage of contracts to be set aside under subsection (c) of this section, the state agency shall exclude any contract that may not be set aside due to a conflict with a federal law or regulation.(e) The head of any awarding agency may, in lieu of setting aside any contract or portions thereof, require any person, business, or any other entity authorized by the agency to award contracts, to set aside a portion of any contract for subcontractors who are eligible for set-aside contracts under this section.

Each certified small business shall file with the division a yearly statement affirming that the business still meets the certification qualifications. (k) The Purchasing Division may deny an application for the initial issuance or renewal of the certification after issuing a written decision to the applicant setting forth the basis for the denial. The Purchasing Division may revoke the certification for cause after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
