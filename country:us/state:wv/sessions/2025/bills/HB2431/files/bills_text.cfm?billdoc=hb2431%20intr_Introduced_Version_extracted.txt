The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America provides that "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized"; that Article 3-5 of the Constitution of the State of West Virginia provides that "The rights of citizens of this state to be secure in their houses, persons, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. No warrant shall issue except upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing the place to be searched, or the person or thing to be searched"; that innovations in surveillance and artificial intelligence pose unique threats to the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures; that said innovations have outpaced the judiciary's ability to determine whether law enforcement's use of such innovations are constitutional; and that, therefore, the Legislature finds and declares that law enforcement's use of certain technological innovations in surveillance and artificial intelligence are inherently unreasonable and unconstitutional. §15-17-3.

(b) No political subdivisions in this state may implement or utilize any of the technologies prohibited by §15-17-3, and any political subdivision that has implemented or utilized any such technologies prior to passage of this article must immediately discontinue such implementation or use.

Private cause of action.
