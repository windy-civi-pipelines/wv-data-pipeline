No data gathered or utilized in this way may be used to negatively impact the patient's costs or availability of services provided by the health insurer or the medical provider. A patient may refuse such a subscription contemplated by this act.(2) If a health insurer or medical provider elects to subscribe to internet service to facilitate data transmission, an Internet service provider may share with the WLAN information, if any, maintained by the Internet service provider with the health insurer or medical provider.
