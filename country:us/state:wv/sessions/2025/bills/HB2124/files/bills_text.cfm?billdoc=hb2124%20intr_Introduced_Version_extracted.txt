OUTDOOR ADVERTISING. §17-22-13. Licenses required; application; expiration; exceptions; revocations; judicial review. (a) No person shall engage or continue in the business of outdoor advertising in this state without first obtaining a license for outdoor advertising from the commissioner; and no person shall construct, erect, operate, use, maintain, lease or sell any outdoor advertising sign, display or device in this state without first obtaining a license from the commissioner. (b) The commissioner shall charge an annual license fee in the amount of $125, payable in advance, for licensees obtaining up to 20 permits. Licensees, including subsidiaries and affiliates, obtaining 21 or more permits shall pay an annual fee of $1,000, payable in advance.

Licenses granted under this section expire on June 30 of each year and shall not be prorated. Applications for the renewal of licenses shall be made not less than 30 days prior to the date of expiration. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to obtain a license who constructs, erects, operates, uses or maintains an on-premise sign, display or device solely on his or her own property at the location of the advertised business and within limitations established in rules authorized by §17-22-11 of this code and promulgated in accordance with state law. (e) The Commissioner of Highways, in his or her discretion, may propose for promulgation an emergency rule as provided in §29A-3-1 et seq. of this code that clarifies, explains or implements limitations or restrictions on the construction, erection, operation, use and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs, displays and devices. With the prior written approval of the Commissioner of Highways, a county commission may enact and enforce outdoor advertising ordinances which place limitations or restrictions on outdoor advertising signs, displays or devices which are in addition to or more restrictive than the limitations or restrictions provided by the Commissioner of Highways in the emergency rule on this subject.(f) The commissioner may, after 30 days' notice in writing to the licensee, make and enter an order revoking any license granted by him or her upon repayment of a proportionate part of the license fee, in any case where he or she finds that any material information required to be given in the application for the license is knowingly false or misleading or that the licensee has violated any of the provisions of this article, unless the licensee, before the expiration of said 30 days, corrects the false or misleading information and complies with the provisions of this article. The order shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the order was made and entered. Any person adversely affected by an order made and entered by the commissioner is entitled to judicial review of the order. The judicial review shall be in the circuit court for the county in which the owner of the sign has his or her principal place of business in this state, or in the circuit court of Kanawha County if all parties agree.

Every application for a changeable message sign shall be accompanied by a fee of $500, which shall be retained by the commissioner if the permit is issued.

Permit renewal fees for all other signs shall be established by legislative rule not to exceed $25 per permit annually. Each portion of an advertising sign upon which a display is posted or exhibited constitutes a separate advertising sign for purposes of this section. If the permit is refused, the commissioner shall make and enter an order to that effect and shall cause a copy of the order to be served on the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall refund one-half the fee to the applicant. The order shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the order was made and entered. Each application shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the applicant or his or her agent that the owner or other person in control or possession of the real property upon which the advertising sign, display or device is to be constructed, erected, operated, used or maintained has consented to having the advertising sign, display or device on his or her property.

The order shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the order was made and entered. If the construction, erection, operation, use or maintenance of any advertising sign, display or device for which a permit is issued by the commissioner and the permit fee has been paid as provided for in this section is prevented by any zoning board, commission or other public agency which also has jurisdiction over the proposed advertising sign, display or device, or its site, the fee for the advertising sign, display or device shall be returned by the commissioner and the permit revoked. But one-half the fee shall be considered to have accrued upon the erection of an advertising sign or structure or the display of advertising material followed by any inspection by the commissioner or his or her representatives.(f) (g) Any person adversely affected by an order made and entered by the commissioner refusing to grant or revoking a permit is entitled to judicial review of the order. The judicial review shall be: (1) In the county in which the person applying for the permit has his or her principal place of business in this state; or (2) in the circuit court for the county in which the sign for which the permit is sought is to be located; or (3) in the circuit court of Kanawha County if all parties agree.
