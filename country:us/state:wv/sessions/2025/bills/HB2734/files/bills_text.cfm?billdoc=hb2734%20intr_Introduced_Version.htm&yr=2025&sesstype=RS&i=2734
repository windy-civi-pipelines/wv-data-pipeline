When the state board determines that schools and school systems do not have the capacity to correct deficiencies, the state board shall take one or more of the following actions:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(1) Work with the county board to develop or secure the resources necessary to increase the capacity of schools and school systems to meet the standards and, when necessary, seek additional resources in consultation with the Legislature and the Governor;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) Recommend to the appropriate body including, but not limited to, the Legislature, county boards, schools and communities methods for targeting resources strategically to eliminate deficiencies identified in the assessment and accountability processes. When making determinations on recommendations, the state board shall include, but is not limited to, the following methods:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">The state board, or its designee, the West Virginia Department of Education, and county school systems, shall work collaboratively in: </span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(1) Examining reports and electronic strategic improvement plans regarding the performance and progress of students, schools and school systems relative to the standards and identifying the areas in which improvement is needed;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) Determining the areas of weakness and of ineffectiveness that appear to have contributed to the substandard performance and progress of students or the deficiencies of the school or school system;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(3) Determining the areas of strength that appear to have contributed to exceptional student, school and school system performance and progress and promoting their emulation throughout the system;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(4) Requesting technical assistance from the School Building Authority in assessing or designing comprehensive educational facilities plans;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(5) Recommending priority funding from the School Building Authority based on identified needs;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(6) Recommending special staff development programs from county boards based on identified needs;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(7) Submitting requests to the Legislature for appropriations to meet the identified needs for improving education;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(8) Directing educational expertise and support services strategically toward alleviating deficiencies;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(9) Ensuring that the need for facilities in counties with increased enrollment are appropriately reflected and recommended for funding;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(10) Ensuring that the appropriate person or entity is held accountable for eliminating deficiencies; and</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(11) Ensuring that the needed capacity is available from the state and local level to assist the school or school system in achieving the standards and alleviating the deficiencies.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(p) </span><span class="cs50A3B802">Building leadership capacity.</span><span class="csE736517A"> &mdash; To help build the governance and leadership capacity of a county board during an intervention in the operation of its school system, and to help assure sustained success following return of control to the county board, the county board shall establish goals and action plans, subject to approval of the state superintendent, to improve performance sufficiently to end the intervention within a period of not more than five years. The state superintendent shall maintain oversight and provide assistance and feedback to the county board on development and implementation of the goals and action plans. At a minimum, the goals and action plans shall include:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(1) An analysis of the training and development activities needed by the county board and leadership of the school system for effective governance and school improvement;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) Support for the training and development activities identified which may include those made available through the state superintendent, West Virginia School Board Association, and other sources identified in the goals and action plans; and</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(3) Active involvement by the county board in the improvement process, working in tandem with the county superintendent to gather, analyze and interpret data, write time-specific goals to correct deficiencies, prepare and implement action plans and allocate or request from the Department of Education the resources, including board development training and coaching, necessary to achieve approved goals and action plans and sustain system and school improvement.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">At least once each year during the period of intervention, the state board shall appoint a designee to assess the readiness of the county board to accept the return of control of the system or school from the state board and sustain the improvements, and shall make a report and recommendations to the state board supported by documented evidence of the progress made on the goals and action plans. The state board may return any portion of control of the operations of the school system or end the intervention in its entirety by a majority vote. If the state board determines at the fifth annual assessment that the county board is still not ready to accept return of control by the state board and sustain the improvements, the state board shall hold a public hearing in the affected county at which the attendance by all members of the county board is requested so that the reasons for continued intervention and the concerns of the citizens of the county may be heard. The state board may continue the intervention only after it holds the public hearing and may require revision of the goals and action plans. The state board must thereafter hold a public hearing after each annual assessment beyond the fifth year. If a school system is in intervention status on the effective date of this provision, the total years of intervention shall be calculated from the date of initial intervention.</span></p><p class="csCF6B950C"><span class="csB15CEB54">Following the termination of an intervention in the operation of a school system and return of full control by the state board, the support for governance education and development shall continue as needed for up to three years. If at any time within this three years, the state board determines that intervention in the operation of the school system is again necessary, the state board shall again hold a public hearing in the affected county so that the reasons for the intervention and the concerns of the citizens of the county may be heard prior to intervening.</span></p><p class="csDE8452F9"><span class="csAD690475">NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to require county boards of education, K though 12 schools, to display school report cards on websites and use the statewide electronic information system established by the state board for data collection and reporting to the state department of education.</span></p><p class="csDE8452F9"><span class="csAD690475">Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.</span></p>
