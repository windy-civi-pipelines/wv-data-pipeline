Although it may manifest itself as a psychiatric condition that would be otherwise precluded from workers&#39; compensation coverage, post-traumatic stress disorder is an occupational hazard for first responders, similar to members of the military serving in combat. The Legislature further finds that because first responders are required to expose themselves to traumatic events during the course of their employment and thus are at a recognized higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder, and because of the severe nature and debilitative effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, it is the moral obligation of the state to permit coverage to this class of individuals for their work-related disease.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(d)(1) Post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by a first responder may be recognized as a compensable occupational disease under &sect;23-4-1(f) of this code when:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(A) The employer has elected to provide coverage for post-traumatic stress disorder as an occupational disease;
