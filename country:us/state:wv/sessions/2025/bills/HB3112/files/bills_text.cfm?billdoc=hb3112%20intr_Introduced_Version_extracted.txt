Upon request, each device that generated the qualifying community air monitoring data shall be provided to the secretary for evaluation.  (e) Based on the secretary’s evaluation of submitted community air monitoring data, the secretary may initiate the collection of follow-up air monitoring data in the community. The follow-up air monitoring data may be collected by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection or other state or federal agencies or their contractors or by upwind facilities that hold or have applied for permits under this article. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to permit the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection to install and monitor air quality using fenceline monitors near facilities that emit air pollution, provide technical assistance to individuals and groups that wish to monitor the air quality in their communities, encourage the Department of Environmental Protection to use the collected data; permit individuals to submit the data collected regarding air pollution to the secretary, and enable the secretary to follow up on any data found from fenceline air quality monitoring.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
