Upon a finding by the court that the deed will not be set aside and with the entry of a judgment dismissing the action with prejudice, the clerk shall return to the plaintiff or other appropriated person whose funds previously tendered, less any accrued costs assessed against such person such funds by the court.  NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to decrease the service period for notice of tax lien sales; and to decrease the statute of limitations for an action to set aside a deed.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
