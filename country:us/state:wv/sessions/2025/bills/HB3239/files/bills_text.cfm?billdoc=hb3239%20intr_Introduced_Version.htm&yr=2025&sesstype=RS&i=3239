Termination of a tri-share agreement. (a) Termination of an active contract between an employer, employee, child-care facility, and the department pursuant to this program shall occur in the following circumstances:(1) If the relationship between the employee and employer is severed, the employer shall notify the child-care facility and the department within 10 business days of the separation, and the contract is terminated on the calendar date provided by the employer in the notification.

If the child-care facility voluntarily excuses the employee's nonpayment or the child-care facility does not notify the department within two calendar months from the date of the employee's nonpayment and continues to provide services, then the contract made between all the parties will automatically reflect the reduction in value; (2) If the child-care provider ceases participation or otherwise loses its licensing, it shall notify all parties to the agreement immediately; or(3) Either the employer or employee may terminate the contract at any time and or any reason. The terminating party shall notify all the parties to the contract and specify the desired termination date, which shall occur no sooner than two weeks from the date of notification unless the child-care facility gives its consent to an earlier termination date. All parties to the contract shall be financially obligated, according to the provisions of the contract, up to the termination date.§5B-12-9. Department of economic development incentives.  The Department Economic Development may incorporate this program into agreements with employers seeking economic development incentives if the employer agrees to participate in the program.§5B-12-10. Penalties.  Any person who intentionally registers false information under §5B-12-1 to §5B-12-9 of this code with the department in pursuit of the benefits of this program shall be subject to a civil penalty of no more than $500 per violation. All money collected as a result of penalties assessed under §5B-12-1 et seq. of this code shall be paid into the State Treasury and credited to the Tri-Share Child-Care Assistance Program fund. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to provide support to West Virginia families by incentivizing employers to contribute to the child-care costs of its employees. In enacting this legislation, it is the intention of the Legislature to enable the Department of Economic Development to facilitate this public and private partnership program and administer program funds to achieve this purpose.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.

The state's match obligations will be allotted as follows:(1) When an employee's household income is equal to or less than 200% of the state's median household income, the state match will be 1/3 or 33.3% of the costs.(2) When an employee's household income is greater than 200% of the state's median household income and equal to or less than 250%, the state match will be 30% of the costs.(3) When an employee's household income is greater than 250% of the state's median household income and equal to or less than 300%, the state match will be 20% of the costs.(4) When an employee's household income is greater than 300% of the state's median household income and equal to or less than 350%, the state match will be 10% of the costs.(5) When employee's household income is greater than 350% of the state's median household income, the state match will be nothing. (i) An employer may decide what amount greater than 1/3 or 33.3% it will contribute as the state match decreases. (j) The department may adjust median household income rates for families of greater than four people: Provided, That  the adjusted rates not be lower than what is determined by the United States Census Bureau.§5B-12-7.
