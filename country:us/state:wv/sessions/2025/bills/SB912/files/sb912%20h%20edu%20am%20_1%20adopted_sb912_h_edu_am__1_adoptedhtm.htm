This intervention may include, but is not limited to, the following:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(A) Limiting the authority of the county board in areas that compromise the delivery of a thorough and efficient education to its students as designated by the state board by rule, which may include delegating decision-making authority regarding these matters to the state superintendent who may:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(B) Declare that the office of the county superintendent is vacant;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(C) Declare that the positions of personnel who serve at the will and pleasure of the county superintendent as provided in &sect;18A-2-1 of this code, are vacant, subject to application and reemployment;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(D) Fill the declared vacancies during the period of intervention; and</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(E) Take any direct action necessary to correct the extraordinary circumstance.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(n) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the state board may intervene immediately in the operation of the county school system with all the powers, duties and responsibilities contained in subsection (m) of this section, if the state board finds any of the following:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(1) A county board fails to act on a statutory obligation which would interrupt the day-to- day operations of the school system;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) That the conditions precedent to intervention exist as provided in this section; and that delaying intervention for any period of time would not be in the best interests of the students of the county school system; or</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(3) That the conditions precedent to intervention exist as provided in this section and that the state board had previously intervened in the operation of the same school system and had concluded that intervention within the preceding five years.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(o)</span><span class="cs50A3B802"> Capacity</span><span class="csE736517A">. &mdash; The process for improving education includes a process for targeting resources strategically to improve the teaching and learning process. Development of electronic school and school system strategic improvement plans, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, is intended, in part, to provide mechanisms to target resources strategically to the teaching and learning process to improve student, school, and school system performance. When deficiencies are detected through the assessment and accountability processes, the revision and approval of school and school system electronic strategic improvement plans shall ensure that schools and school systems are efficiently using existing resources to correct the deficiencies. When the state board determines that schools and school systems do not have the capacity to correct deficiencies, the state board shall take one or more of the following actions:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(1) Work with the county board to develop or secure the resources necessary to increase the capacity of schools and school systems to meet the standards and, when necessary, seek additional resources in consultation with the Legislature and the Governor;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) Recommend to the appropriate body including, but not limited to, the Legislature, county boards, schools and communities methods for targeting resources strategically to eliminate deficiencies identified in the assessment and accountability processes.

The state superintendent shall maintain oversight and provide assistance and feedback to the county board on development and implementation of the goals and action plans. At a minimum, the goals and action plans shall include:</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(1) An analysis of the training and development activities needed by the county board and leadership of the school system for effective governance and school improvement;</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(2) Support for the training and development activities identified which may include those made available through the state superintendent, West Virginia School Board Association, and other sources identified in the goals and action plans; and</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">(3) Active involvement by the county board in the improvement process, working in tandem with the county superintendent to gather, analyze and interpret data, write time-specific goals to correct deficiencies, prepare and implement action plans and allocate or request from the Department of Education the resources, including board development training and coaching, necessary to achieve approved goals and action plans and sustain system and school improvement.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">At least once each year during the period of intervention, the state board shall appoint a designee to assess the readiness of the county board to accept the return of control of the system or school from the state board and sustain the improvements, and shall make a report and recommendations to the state board supported by documented evidence of the progress made on the goals and action plans. The state board may return any portion of control of the operations of the school system or end the intervention in its entirety by a majority vote. If the state board determines at the fifth annual assessment that the county board is still not ready to accept return of control by the state board and sustain the improvements, the state board shall hold a public hearing in the affected county at which the attendance by all members of the county board is requested so that the reasons for continued intervention and the concerns of the citizens of the county may be heard. The state board may continue the intervention only after it holds the public hearing and may require revision of the goals and action plans. The state board must thereafter hold a public hearing after each annual assessment beyond the fifth year. If a school system is in intervention status on the effective date of this provision, the total years of intervention shall be calculated from the date of initial intervention.</span></p><p class="cs45E53620"><span class="csE736517A">Following the termination of an intervention in the operation of a school system and return of full control by the state board, the support for governance education and development shall continue as needed for up to three years.
