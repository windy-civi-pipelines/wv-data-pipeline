(d) Internet service providers shall provide data concerning the number of customers receiving credits per month, the total dollar amount of credits provided per month, and the geographic scope of outages of 120 hours or more for which credits were required.

In months where there are no outages for 120 hours or more for which credits were required, no report shall be required.
