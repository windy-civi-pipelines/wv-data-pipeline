(c) The fact that a utility has already raised its rates in a given year pursuant to §24-2-4i(a) of this Code shall not preclude a utility from applying for and receiving from the commission or its governing body a rate increase pursuant to the provisions delineated in this section. Provided, That the commission or applicable governing body shall take into account the prior rate increase taken pursuant to this section when considering the utility’s application to increase rates.(d) After September 30 of each year, the commission shall issue a general order stating the percentage increase in the Index and the inflation factor to apply to the rates currently in effect to calculate the maximum rate increase authorized by §24-2-4i(a) of this Code.

(e)(1) A rate increase pursuant to §24-2-4i(a) of this Code shall be subject to challenge by the commission only if (A) the utility is not a municipal utility and is a utility with fewer than 4,500 customers and annual gross combined revenues of less than $3 million, and(B) the commission determines that the increase is in fact in excess of the amount of the increase in the Index for the relevant time period. If the commission determines that such rate increase is in excess of the increase in the Index for the relevant time period, it may enter an order suspending the rate increase. If such an order is entered, the utility shall be entitled to a hearing as authorized in §24-2-3 or §24-2-4a of this code or it may correct its requested rates, in which case the suspension will be lifted and the rates may go into effect as of the original requested effective date or the date that the utility corrects its rates, whichever comes later. (2) A county commission may request that the commission review a rate increase implemented by a utility with at least 4,500 customers and annual gross combined revenues of $3 million or more under §24-2-4i(a) of this Code to determine whether such increase is in excess of the amount of the increase in the Index for the relevant time period.

(2) A municipally owned water and/or sewer utility may implement up to four annual indexed rate increases under §24-2-4i(a) of this Code before seeking passage of an ordinance pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 8 of this code. (3) A publicly owned water and/or sewer utility that is not a municipal utility and that has 4,500 or more customers and annual gross combined revenues of $3 million or more, may implement up to four annual indexed rate increases under §24-2-4i(a) of this Code before filing for approval of rates pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 16 of this code.(g) The commission shall prescribe such rules and regulations as to the giving of notice of a change in rates pursuant to this section as are deemed reasonable and proper, and in the public interest. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to set appropriate time frames and procedures for rate increases for water and sewerage utilities.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
