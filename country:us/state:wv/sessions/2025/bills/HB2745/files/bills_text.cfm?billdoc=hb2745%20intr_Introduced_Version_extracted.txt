(a) Neither a depositor nor a beneficiary has a property interest in a special deposit.(b) Any property interest with respect to a special deposit is only in the right to receive payment if the bank is obligated to pay a beneficiary and not in the special deposit itself. Any property interest under this subsection is determined under other law. §31A-9-9. When creditor process enforceable against bank. (a) Subject to subsection (b) of this section, creditor process with respect to a special deposit is not enforceable against the bank holding the special deposit. (b) Creditor process is enforceable against the bank holding a special deposit with respect to an amount the bank is obligated to pay a beneficiary or a depositor if the process:(1)  Is served on the bank;(2) Provides sufficient information to permit the bank to identify the depositor or the beneficiary from the bank's books and records; and(3) Gives the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the process.(c) Creditor process served on a bank before it is enforceable against the bank under subsection (b) of this section does not create a right of the creditor against the bank or a duty of the bank to the creditor. Other law determines whether creditor process creates a lien enforceable against the beneficiary on a contingent interest of a beneficiary, including a depositor as a beneficiary, even if not enforceable against the bank. §31A-9-10. Injunction or similar relief. A court may enjoin or grant similar relief that would have the effect of enjoining a bank from paying a depositor or beneficiary only if payment would constitute a material fraud or facilitate a material fraud with respect to a special deposit. §31A-9-11. Recoupment or set off. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) or subsection (c) of this section, a bank may not exercise a right of recoupment or set off against a special deposit. (b) An account agreement may authorize the bank to debit the special deposit:(1) When the bank becomes obligated to pay a beneficiary, in an amount that does not exceed the amount necessary to discharge the obligation;(2) For a fee assessed by the bank that relates to an overdraft in the special deposit account; (3) For costs incurred by the bank that relate directly to the special deposit; or(4) To reverse an earlier credit posted by the bank to the balance of the special deposit account, if the reversal occurs under an event or circumstance warranted under other law of this state governing mistake and restitution.(c) The bank holding a special deposit may exercise a right of recoupment or set off against an obligation to pay a beneficiary, even if the bank funds payment from the special deposit. §31A-9-12. Duties and liability of bank. (a) A bank does not have a fiduciary duty to any person with respect to a special deposit. (b) When the bank holding a special deposit becomes obligated to pay a beneficiary, a debtor-creditor relationship arises between the bank and beneficiary.(c) The bank holding a special deposit has a duty to a beneficiary to comply with the account agreement and this article. (d) If the bank holding a special deposit does not comply with the account agreement or this article, the bank is liable to a depositor or beneficiary only for damages proximately caused by the noncompliance. Except as provided by other law of this state, the bank is not liable for consequential, special, or punitive damages.(e) The bank holding a special deposit may rely on records presented in compliance with the account agreement to determine whether the bank is obligated to pay a beneficiary.(f) If the account agreement requires payment on presentation of a record, the bank shall determine within a reasonable time whether the record is sufficient to require payment. If the agreement requires action by the bank on presentation of a record, the bank is not liable for relying in good faith on the genuineness of the record if the record appears on its face to be genuine.(g) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the bank is not required to determine whether a permissible purpose stated in the agreement continues to exist. §31A-9-13. Term and termination. (a) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, a special deposit terminates five years after the date the special deposit was first funded.(b) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, if the bank cannot identify or locate a beneficiary entitled to payment when the special deposit is terminated, and a balance remains in the special deposit, the bank shall pay the balance to the depositor or depositors as a beneficiary or beneficiaries.(c)  A bank that pays the remaining balance as provided under subsection (b) of this section has no further obligation with respect to the special deposit. §31A-9-14. Principles of law and equity. The provisions of Chapter 46 and Chapter 46A of this code, law governing deposits generally, law related to escheat and abandoned or unclaimed property, and the principles of law and equity, including law related to capacity to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, and bankruptcy, supplement this article except to the extent inconsistent with this article. §31A-9-15. Uniformity of application and construction. In applying and construing this uniform act, a court shall consider the promotion of uniformity of the law among jurisdictions that enact it. §31A-9-16. Transitional provision. This article applies to:(1) A special deposit made under an account agreement executed on or after the effective date of this article; and(2) A deposit made under an agreement executed before enactment of this article, if:(A) All parties entitled to amend the agreement agree to make the deposit a special deposit governed by this article; and(B) The special deposit referenced in the amended agreement satisfies §31A-9-5 of this code.NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to provide for the creation of the Uniform Special Deposits Act.This bill was recommended for passage during the 2025 legislative session by the Commission on Interstate Cooperation.Strike-throughs indicate language that would be stricken from a heading or the present law and underscoring indicates new language that would be added.
