Howell and W. Clark[[February 13, 2025; referred to the Committee on Rules ]]Declaring December 14 as "Frosty the Snowman Day."Whereas, "Frosty the Snowman" was written by Walter "Jack" Rollins of Keyser, Mineral County, West Virginia, and Steve Nelson.  Walter "Jack" Rollins was born on September 15, 1906, and died on January 1, 1973.  He wrote over 500 songs, several with Mr. Nelson. "Frosty the Snowman" was released December 14, 1950, and performed by cowboy singer and actor Gene Autry and the Cass County Boys and quickly became a winter classic; and Whereas, We can imagine this song to be about a jolly happy soul, perhaps a West Virginia mountaineer, "with a corn cob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of" West Virginia coal.  What better way to celebrate the holiday season than honoring December 14 as "Frosty the Snowman Day" and at the same time remembering and honoring the songs of a native West Virginia mountaineer who wrote the words to Frosty as well as "Here Comes Peter Cottontail", "Smokey the Bear" and the Hank Snow hit, "I Don’t Hurt Anymore"; therefore, be itResolved by the Legislature of West Virginia:That December 14 be declared as "Frosty the Snowman Day".
