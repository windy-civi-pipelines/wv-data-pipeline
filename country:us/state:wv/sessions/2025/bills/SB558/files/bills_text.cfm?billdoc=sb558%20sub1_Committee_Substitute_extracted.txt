State Board of Education. §18-2-9b. Computer Science Course. (a) Beginning with the ninth-grade class entering in the 2027-2028 school year, a public high school student shall be required to earn a minimum of one-half unit of credit in a high school computer science course before the student graduates.(b) "Computer science" means the study of computers, programming, and algorithms, including their principles, their hardware and software designs, their implementation, and their impact on society. Computer science does not include the study of everyday uses of computers and computer applications, such as keyboarding, word processing, digital literacy, or accessing the internet.(c) A computer science course offered for high school credit shall meet or exceed the standards established by the state board. The course shall be offered in person in a traditional classroom setting unless it is not feasible for a school district to do so.

If the rules allow a computer science course to fulfill a math credit or a science credit and a student uses a computer science course to fulfil the math or science credit, the school district shall denote that computer science course as equivalent to a high school math course or high school science course, as applicable, on the student’s transcript for the purpose of admission to a higher education institution in this state.(f) The state board shall update computer science standards to include high school introductory computer science courses that include foundational computer science concepts.(g) Beginning in August of 2026, the state board shall make available to all public schools a list of course options that can meet the requirements for this credit. The state board shall update the list as often as necessary.(h) The state board shall adopt additional rules to ensure schools can obtain the necessary teacher capacity to support implementation of this section. Such rules shall include flexible options to license computer science teachers, including, but not limited to, an authorization or endorsement.(i) In addition to any rules required by this section, the state board may adopt any other rules it deems necessary to administer this section.
