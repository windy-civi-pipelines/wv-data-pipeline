West Virginia Feed to Achieve Act. §18-5D-6. Summer Feeding for All. (a) The Legislature finds and declares that:(1) The Feed to Achieve initiative has successfully improved the availability and awareness for the need to provide nutritious food to state students and the Shared Table Initiative has facilitated a spirit of innovation and consciousness in our counties to find alternative ways to feed children in need; (2) A periodic assessment of the needs for county students and availability of county resources is necessary to determine what type of resources are available and needed to reduce food insecurity for students when they are not in school; (3) That expansion of the Shared Table Initiative to include a program to encourage county schools to locate, participate in, and initiate programs to provide meals during summers and non-school-day times when some children may not have access to healthy meals could assist in reducing food insecurity for thousands of children in this state, and therefore, creating a mechanism that is not a directive from the Legislature upon county school boards, but rather an authorization to use school resources to find innovative ways, within the means of the county school systems, to assist the communities they serve, will provide a public benefit. (b) Any Every county public school system may shall conduct an annual countywide survey of public-school students to determine their non-school eating patterns and the availability of nutritious food to them when schools are closed.

Community support and resources should be utilized when creating this plan(h) (g) The West Virginia Office of Child Nutrition shall monitor these activities and share between counties information about innovative and successful program initiatives around the state to promote and facilitate the Summer Feeding for All program. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to establish the Summer Feeding for All initiative that will encourage county school systems to look for innovative ways to provide assistance to students in need to access nutritious foods during summer break and other times when school is not in session.
