Legislative findings. The Legislature finds that:(1) West Virginia, as a national energy leader, is positioned to create a voluntary market for the sale and purchase of carbon offset credits.(2) Increased use of pollution prevention strategies, more cost-effective options for compliance with environmental standards, and improvement of environmental performance can be achieved through the establishment of a Carbon Exchange Program. (3) While West Virginia's existing environmental laws play an important role in protecting the environment, environmental protection could be further enhanced by authorizing innovative advances in environmental regulatory methods and approaches.(4) A state-regulated Carbon Exchange Program will further West Virginia's role as an energy leader, incentivize economic investment, encourage environmental protection, and protect West Virginia forest landowners, forest product businesses, and consumers. §22-37-3.

The purpose of this article is to authorize the Division of Forestry to administer a Carbon Exchange Program, known as the Carbon Exchange, to regulate the sale and purchase of carbon credits, and which shall serve as the exclusive contracting platform for all carbon credit agreements encumbering or involving real property and standing timber located in West Virginia. The division shall develop scientific methodologies that calculate and include the long-term carbon captures from the production of forest products and a substitution factor (or product displacement factor) accounting for the use of forest products over products that would have a higher carbon emissions footprint. §22-37-4.
