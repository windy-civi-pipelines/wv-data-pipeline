(a) Purpose.  Ì¶ There is hereby created the Independent Redistricting Commission of the Joint Committee on Government and Finance ("Redistricting Commission"), established generally to provide a proposed fair, balanced, and rational plan for redistricting of congressional and state legislative voting districts for final approval by the Legislature.  The Redistricting Commission shall, among other duties and tasks noted herein, acquire, review, study, and evaluate appropriate information related to establishing and designating voting districts, prepare a report, and present proposed redistricting mappings designed to reflect fair reapportionment and redistricting in conformity with constitutional principles, especially that which requires equality of population to the greatest extent practicable.

(d) Appointment and Qualifications of Redistricting Commission Members.  Ì¶ The President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Delegates, and the minority leaders of the Senate and the House of Delegates shall each designate one member of the Redistricting Commission. The state chair of the two largest political parties, determined by the vote cast for Governor in the last gubernatorial election, shall each designate one member of the Redistricting Commission.  Any official who fails to make an appointment within the specified time shall forfeit the appointment privilege.  If there are two or more minority parties within the House of Delegates or the Senate, the leader of the largest minority party by statewide party registration shall make the appointment.(1)  At the time of their selection each member shall be a registered West Virginia voter who has been continuously registered with the same political party, or unaffiliated, for three or more years immediately preceding their appointment.

(f) Reimbursement of Redistricting Commission Members, Staff.

(B) If a second plan is required under this section, the bill embodying it shall be delivered to the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Delegates not later than two months after the date of the vote by which the Senate or the House of Delegates fails to approve the bill first submitted.  If it is necessary to submit a bill under this section, the bill shall be brought to a vote in not less than two months, in the same manner as prescribed for the first bill required under this section.(3) If the bill embodying the plan submitted by the Redistricting Commission Office under subdivision (2) of this section fails to be approved by a constitutional majority in either the Senate or the House of Delegates, the same procedure as prescribed by subdivision (2) of this section shall be followed.(A) If a third plan is required, the bill embodying it shall be delivered to the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Delegates not later than two months after the date of the vote by which the Senate or the House of Delegates fails to approve the bill submitted under subdivision (2) of this section, but before the beginning of the next regular session of the Legislature.  If it is necessary to submit a bill under this subsection, the bill shall be brought to a vote within the same time after its delivery to the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Delegates as is prescribed for the bill submitted under subdivision (2) of this section.(B) If it is necessary to submit a third bill under this section, that bill shall be subject to amendment in the Legislature in the same manner as any other bills in the regular legislative process. NOTE: The purpose of this bill is to provide for the Redistricting Office of the Joint Committee on Government and Finance to propose redistricting plans during census years.
