The hospital may then only implement the increase approved by the Attorney General.  Should the Attorney General determine that a reimbursement agreement with a third party payor includes pricing terms at anti-competitive levels, the Attorney General may reject the reimbursement agreement and communicate such rejection to the parties thereto together with the rationale therefor in a timely manner.(2) The authority shall maintain on file all cooperative agreements the authority has approved, including any conditions imposed by the authority.(3) Any party to a cooperative agreement that terminates its participation in such cooperative agreement shall file a notice of termination with the authority thirty days after termination.(4)  No hospital which is a party to a cooperative agreement for which approval is required pursuant to this section may knowingly bill or charge for health services resulting from, or associated with, such cooperative agreement until approved by the authority.  Additionally, no hospital which is a party to a cooperative agreement may knowingly bill or charge for health services resulting from, or associated with, such cooperative agreement for which approval has been revoked or terminated.(5) By submitting an application for review of a cooperative agreement pursuant to this section, the hospitals or health care providers shall be deemed to have agreed to submit to the regulation and supervision of the authority as provided in this section.(j) To ensure protection from antitrust action under state and federal antitrust laws a hospital which has merged, consolidated or acquired a hospital after January 1, 2017 shall file a cooperative agreement under the provisions of this section before January 1, 2026.
