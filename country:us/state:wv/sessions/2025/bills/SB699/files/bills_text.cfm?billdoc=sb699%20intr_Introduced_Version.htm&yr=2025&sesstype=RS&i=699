Legislative findings. The Legislature finds that:(1) Atmospheric polluting activities involving the intentional release of polluting emissions, including weather modification, stratospheric aerosol injection, solar radiation modification, and other forms of geoengineering: (A) Endanger human health and safety and the environment;(B) Threaten air, water, soil, and wildlife resources;(C) Disrupt agricultural operations; and (D) Potentially interfere with aviation, state security, and the economy of the state;(2) Pursuant to the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and the inherent right for West Virginia citizens to engage in thoughtful deliberation and determine public policy by voting, the citizens of the state do not consent to any unconstitutional actions or efforts made by the federal government or international bodies that intentionally release polluting emissions into the state's atmosphere, through geoengineering, cloud seeding, weather modification, or any other means; and (3) To preserve the safe and healthful uses of the state's atmosphere for its people, environment, and agriculture, and to improve beneficial climate efforts, it is necessary to prohibit geoengineering and to provide for enforcement and penalties for violative activities. §22-37-2. Definitions. As used in this article:(1) "Aerosol injection" means the release of reflective sulfate or other aerosol particles in the stratosphere by high altitude planes, tethered balloons, high altitude blimps, artillery, or other means;(2) "Artificial intelligence" or "AI" means systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and that can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect;(3) (A) "Atmospheric contaminant" means any type of aerosol, biological, nonbiological, or hazardous agent, chaff, genetically modified agent, metal, radioactive material, vapor, electromagnetic radiation or field, mechanical vibration, particulate of any size, or any air pollutant regulated by the state, and any combination thereof. (B) "Atmospheric contaminant" does not include any engine exhaust from an aircraft using unadulterated certified aviation fuel;(4) "Atmospheric polluting activity" means any deliberate release of an atmospheric  contaminant by any human, or by artificial intelligence, or any combination thereof, that occurs in the atmosphere and that may have harmful consequences on human health, the environment, or agriculture; (5) "Chaff" means aluminum-coated silica glass fibers, typically dispersed in bundles containing millions of inhalable fibers, which break apart and fall to the ground;(6) "Cloud seeding" means a type of weather modification that involves the deliberate introduction of various substances into a cloud in order to induce or increase precipitation from the cloud;(7) "Commissioner" means the commissioner of the Department for Environmental  Protection;(8) "Department" means the Department for Environmental Protection;(9) "Entity" means any individual, trust, firm, joint stock company, corporation, quasi-governmental corporation, nongovernmental organization, partnership, association, syndicate, club, college, university, any agency, subdivision, or instrumentality of federal, state, or local government, or any interstate or international governance body;(10) "Geoengineering" means the intentional manipulation of the environment, through an atmospheric polluting activity, to effect changes to the earth's atmosphere or surface, including but not limited to the practices of weather modification, aerosol injection, and cloud seeding;(11) "Hazardous" means a substance or physical agent that by its nature is harmful to living organisms, property, or any other valuable interest;(12) "Individual" means a natural person;(13) "Maser" means a device using the stimulated emission of radiation by excited atoms to amplify or generate radiation in the microwave range;(14) "Person" means an individual, business association, financial organization, estate, trust, government, governmental subdivision, agency, or instrumentality, or any other legal or commercial entity.(15) "Physical agent" means a source of energy that may cause injury through  excessive exposure, including but not limited to radiofrequency, microwave, and other electromagnetic radiation and fields, barometric pressure, temperature, gravity, mechanical vibration, and sound;(16) "Release" means any activity that results in the issuance of atmospheric  contaminants such as the emitting, transmitting, discharging, or injecting of one or more nuclear, biological, chemical, or physical agents into the ambient atmosphere, whether once, intermittently, or continuously;(17) "Solar radiation modification" means any attempt to reduce global temperatures by reflecting more sunlight into space or allowing more infrared radiation from earth to escape than would naturally occur; and(18) "Weather modification" means the changing, controlling, or interfering with or  attempting to change, control, or interfere with the natural development of cloud forms, precipitation, barometric pressure, temperature, conductivity or other electromagnetic or sonic characteristics of the atmosphere. §22-37-3. Prohibitions on geoengineering activities. (a) No entity shall engage in any form of geoengineering activities within or over the state of West Virginia. The commissioner shall investigate any credible reports of geoengineering occurring in the state received under this article, and shall issue an order to any entity that he or she finds is engaging in geoengineering to immediately cease all geoengineering activities.
