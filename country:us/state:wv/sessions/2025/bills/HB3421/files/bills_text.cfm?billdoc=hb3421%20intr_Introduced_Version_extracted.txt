Actions to be undertaken by power-generating utilities. (a) Electric generating units operating in the State of West Virginia shall balance the economic dispatch of each plant in coordination with optimum performance and desired capacity factor, management of its fuel supply and overall plant operation to ensure critical key results are maintained i.e. optimizing stable energy costs, assuring adequate base fuel supplies, maintaining local jobs and revenues to local communities.

(c) The West Virginia Public Service Commission shall undertake a review of the factors and criteria associated with the economic dispatch of the state’s coal power plants. The review shall consider the differences between economic dispatch of coal fired power plants and other electric generating units, the dispatch calculations of other utilities and jurisdictions.
