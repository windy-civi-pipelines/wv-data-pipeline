Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U.S.941 (1982) that forbidding commercial exportation of groundwater from Nebraska was unconstitutional in that it violated the dormant commerce clause; andWhereas, the United States Supreme Court found in Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 (1945) that Arizona's law limiting train length placed an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce and that the law limiting trains imposed a burden far greater than necessary to achieve Arizona's legitimate interest in lowering the rate of train accidents, violating the dormant commerce clause; andWhereas, The dormant commerce clause is used to prohibit state legislation that discriminates against, or unduly burdens, interstate or international commerce; andWhereas, The restriction affecting West Virginia's inability to provide input would unduly burden interstate commerce by Maryland by attempting to restrict West Virginia businesses on water discharge beyond the Federal EPA requirements; andWhereas, the Attorney General serves as the chief legal officer for the State of West Virginia and speaks for the legal interests of the state; andWhereas, the Attorney General also is entrusted with enforcing the laws of the State as they relate to consumer protection, unfair trade practices, constitutional protections, and other important areas; therefore, be itResolved by the Legislature of West Virginia:Based on the aforementioned case law, the West Virginia Legislature requests that the Maryland General Assembly reject any legislation proposing to change the stream designation of the North Branch of the Potomac River from the mouth of the Savage River extending to the area of Pinto, Maryland, from a "Warm Water Aquatic Life" use to a "Cold Water Aquatic Life" use as it would violate the Interstate Commerce Clause of the United State Constitution and impose an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce and on the State of West Virginia; and, be itFurther Resolved, That the Legislature calls upon the Attorney General to immediately investigate the constitutionality of the Maryland legislation proposing to change the stream designation of the North Branch of the Potomac River from the mouth of the Savage River extending to the area of Pinto, Maryland,  from a "Warm Water Aquatic Life" use to a "Cold Water Aquatic Life" use and seek any and all appropriate legal remedies to defend the rights of the State of West Virginia as it relates to interstate commerce; and be itFurther Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the West Virginia Attorney General; Governor Wes Moore of Maryland; Bill Ferguson, President of the Senate, Maryland General Assembly; Adrienne A. Jones, Speaker of the House, Maryland General Assembly; Maryland Senator Mike McKay; Maryland Delegate Jim Hinebaugh, Jr.; Maryland Delegate Jason C. Buckel; and Maryland Delegate Terry L. Baker.
